        <p>I’ve been  contemplating posting this story  for some time, clearly  this is not
one of  my finest  moments. I’ve  decided to  share it  because other’s  find it

<hr />

<p>As is normal for me, when I get a new  toy I want to use it. At this point we’ve
owned Taleisin  for a few weeks.  I’ve been out on  her once with Chad  from the
CYA. He  showed me how to  barge using Cheeky and  the 2.5hp motor, and  he also
taught  me how  to scull.  Chad  is super  experienced,  I didn’t  do the  whole
procedure myself and I don’t have any “what if” plans.</p>

<p>I came up with a plan, if 2.5hp can do it, I can get an inflatable with a bigger
engine and that should  make things much easier. So I go shopping,  I get a 2.6m
Zodiac and an  8hp outboard. Armed with a  new sure fire way to  get Taleisin in
and out of  the marina I study the  weather forecasts and pick a  day that seems
like it would be perfect.
<!--more--></p>

<p>We get  up early on Saturday  morning, I’m very excited  - like a little  kid on
christmas morning. When  I’m excited about things,  I don’t hide it  very well -
everybody knows. Annie mentioned to me in the  car on the way to the marina that
she can tell that it’s one of those excited days for me.</p>

<p>Once we’re onboard at the marina I  start putting the inflatable together (I now
seem to  call her Ducky).  I attached  some lines to  Ducky, dropped her  in the
water and started to  tie her to the quarter. Keep in mind  this was pretty much
winter time  in New  Zealand so  I was  wearing foul  weather gear  and thermals
underneath them. It’s taken quite a bit longer to set everything up, which I now
know is normal for everything boat related. Eventually we get Taleisin ready for
sailing and start to go over “the plan”.</p>

<p>So what’s the plan, Annie asks? We drop the mooring lines, I put the outboard in
reverse. We back out slowly, use Taleisin’s  rudder to steer and then get out of
here. Lets just give  it a go. That’s fine, Annie said, but  the wind has picked
up a bit…</p>

<p>We’ll be fine, I said…</p>

<p>We dropped the mooring  lines, I put the outboard in  reverse and Taleisin backs
out slowly. All  is going great so  far. Watch out behind you,  said Annie, that
boat is getting closer. I look behind me. I put the outboard in forward. We move
forward. Move the  tiller to the other  side we need to turn.  It’s not working,
says Annie. The wind was blowing the bow  off. We’re going to hit in front Annie
yells. Back in reverse. We do this a  few times. While we’re doing this the wind
is blowing  us sideways down  the channel.  “Take the dingy  and go push  on the
bow”, yells a spectator. What he didn’t know  is that I made a fatal mistake and
secured the dinghy a bit too well and there  was no way I would be able to untie
it in time. This was completely and utterly stupid of me.</p>

<p>I decided  to just  gun the outboard.  We need to  pick up  way so we  can turn.
That’s what the  problem is. We’re still  not turning. Back in  reverse, gun it!
Whoops that  boat behind  me is  getting close. I  hit a  piling with  the stern
anchor - I’ve bent  it slightly but it will survive. At this  point I think that
it might  be a  good idea to  go forward.  By now  the bow is  in a  much better
position  and we  might actually  get out.  I reach  for the  gear lever  on the
outboard and flick it to forward…</p>

<p>Did I say we’ll be fine? I was wrong…</p>

<p>Except for the fact that I didn’t close the throttle while almost at full speed.
Big mistake. Rookie Mistake. The dingy still  tied to the quarter lifts it’s bow
out of the water and stands up right, I  try to hang onto the seat. No luck. The
outboard gets drowned. I end up in  the water. Taleisin is still heading for the
boats in front  of her. Annie thinking  quickly and with a bit  of guidance from
the audience we’ve now assembled on the dock, sprints up the bowsprit, grabs the
forestay, both feet up against the boat in front of us. She fends like a champ!</p>

<p>No crash  yet, that’s  good right.  While all of  this is  happening I’m  in the
water. Thinking to myself “oh crap, I have  to get back on board because this is
going south fast”. Hanging off the side  of Taleisin I quickly drag myself up to
the bow so I can get up on the bobstay to climb back on board. Another spectator
on the dock yells, get your motor going! I hop in Ducky, try to get her started,
no luck.</p>

<p>As soon as I get  back on board I see one of our  neighbors motoring out to come
and rescue us. “Throw  me a line”, he yells! “I’ll tow you  into the channel, no
worries mate”! I declined and opted to go back to the slip. “I killed the motor,
no idea how I’ll get back”!</p>

<p>Just as we’re pulling  into the slip the marina boat shows up.  I quietly say to
Annie, I’m  in a  lot of trouble  now, they wont  be happy  about this. I  had a
sheepish  look  on my  face  and  was very  apologetic  about  the whole  thing.
Everybody just smiled and said “that’s boating, it won’t be your last…”</p>

<p>At this point I’m feeling pretty well  defeated. I’ve been defeated in the past,
but  NEVER like  this. Usually  there’s  some upside  to  the defeat  for me.  I
honestly could not  find an upside, nothing  went well. I did a  bunch of really
dumb  things,  and I  couldn’t  even  try to  deny  it.  The results  spoke  for
themselves.</p>

<p>The marina boat  crew and our rescue crew  just had a chuckle and  were on their
way. We did give our rescuer a pack of beers as a thank you.</p>

<p>The outboard seemed to be fine when I got  it home and started it, I had a small
win. I was moping around for a few  days not quite knowing how to deal with this
defeat. My  tail was  firmly tucked  between my  legs. I  started reading  up on
warping techniques and  other engineless maneuvers. It took me  a while to build
up the courage to  take Taleisin out again. I did have  a perfect excuse though,
winter was in full swing and the weather was pretty nasty. My research paid off,
eventually,  we moved  Taleisin  to her  mooring  on our  own  without too  much
trouble. I  should probably listen to  Annie more, but my  stubbornness seems to
get the better of me at times.</p>

<hr />

<p>Please feel  free to  leave a comment  with your own  experiences. I  think I’ve
recovered from the trauma inflicted upon my  ego, you’re allowed to have a laugh
at my expense. Looking forward to hearing from anybody who reads this.</p>
