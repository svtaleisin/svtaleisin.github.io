<title>            Crossing an Ocean part 3      Taleisin - Adventure Machine!      </title>




<meta name="description" content="This is part three of a three part post, see partsone andtwo first if youhaven’t read them.I read somewhere that luck on a boat is created by placing luck tokens ina black box. You cannot see how many tokens are in the box and you never knowhow many you use (the assumption is all of them). You place these tokens inthere by doing preventative maintenance. Every time you fix something smallthat’s not quite ready to be done you add a token. It’s essential to add as manytokens as you can because you don’t know how many is in the box. When things gosideways out on the open ocean you make a withdrawal from that box, you neverknow how much you withdraw since you don’t know how much is in there. But thatis where luck comes from. The little string I replaced caused the cotter pin tostick around, it was lucky since I could have lost it. We certainly made a fewwithdrawals! This is also the reason I went to fix the hatch, who knows whatthat might have prevented.We continued on our way. The wind was such that we couldn’t sail East. We headedtowards Minerva reef. This is fine as we know there’s a wind shift coming. Itwas around this point that we realized we’d reached the point of no return.A good friend of mine describes commitment with the following analogy. If youconsider bacon and eggs. The chicken was involved in the breakfast, but the pigwas committed. We realized that we were the pig in this scenario. We cannot turnback since we’d have to repeat everything we’d just come through, we have tocarry on!         View this post on Instagram          Pictures making landfall in Tonga. Seethe blog post at http://www.taleisin.com/crossing-an-ocean-part-3/ (will beposted shortly) A post shared by  Annie Ryan(@svtaleisin) on Aug 29, 2019 at 9:03pmPDTBob sent us a message asking how things were going since he hadn’t heard fromus. It was late at night and I replied immediately, he must not have gotten ittill the next day. His reply the next morning was, “I was hoping you’d befurther East, you’re close to Minerva, anchor there and leave in two days time.The wind is not in your favor!”Bugger, Bob, we’re sixty three nautical miles North of Minerva already; that’sa long way to go back! That’s OK just heave to for the night and carry on in themorning then, he replied. Well heaving to is not an option right now, it wouldbe more uncomfortable due to the confusion on the seas and the wind is notblowing enough to help out. We decided to push on but slow Taleisin down toa crawl. North is still progress towards our goal so we’ll wait for the shift.We spent the next two days waiting for the shift. We didn’t realize that thesixteen knot current flowing East would actually prevent us from sailing eastcompletely. The wind was blowing from the east and this caused two meter chop toform. We could sail North and South, but absolutely not East! We spent the nexttwo days doing just that. It’s around this time that the reality of the mentalchallenge came home for me. Little things started getting to me. I was up on thebowsprit trying to take the jib down. I got dunked in the water when thebowsprit went under. I was wearing my foul weather gear and, of course, my bootsfilled with water. It’s not the first time this has happened. But I had beencomplaining about the fact that my foul weather gear is more akin to fairweather gear. I get completely soaked if the conditions get a bit rougher. Theydidn’t keep me dry and would stay wet for days. The issue was most likelyrelated to the amount of salt that had soaked into them by now. If I sat in thecockpit when it was wet the water would quickly soak through.It got to the point where I stripped down completely before donning my foulweather gear as I was going to get wet. This caused me to be wet and cold everytime I had to go up in less than ideal conditions, which seemed constantly to meat this point. I had a minor meltdown. Annie growled at me to get my acttogether and get on with the task so I can get down below.After three days of not making progress it seemed like we were going to be stuckin limbo for ever. Turning back was not an option and moving forward wasimpossible. Lets just say that our morale was a little bit low at this point.Annie started digging out some comfort food. While she was provisioning shewould stash away little treats especially for me. I tend not to go for comfortfood as much, but she must have known that there will come a point in time whereI’d need it. She’d gone above and beyond and stashed quite a bit away. Shebrought it all out and laid out a Smörgåsbord of chocolate in front of me. Shealso pulled out a tin of BBQ Pringles. If there was no other reason to love her,this would be reason enough alone! It did wonders for my low morale! At the timewe still had two hundred and sixty five nautical miles to go before we reachedVava’u.Annie woke me up at midnight to change watch. We spent a bit of time discussinga change of plan to make landfall at Tongatapu instead. We both needed to ‘getsomewhere’ desperately. I spent my shift planning a new route and it looked likewe might be able to make landfall much sooner. Finally at 3:30 am the windsshifted. Annie changed course! We were elated that we managed to get a break. Wewere heading South East, but that didn’t matter we were heading East! Bobsuggested that we keep that course and round Tongatapu on the Southern end andmake landfall once the winds shift. We kept pushing through the night andthought that we might actually have a shot at making landfall in the nearfuture.The next day we lost the wind. We were drifting towards Tonga but we certainlyweren’t sailing. As much as that might sound painful it was actually a nicechange. We got to relax all day, the weather was nice and we managed to recoversome much needed energy! Annie put a lot of wet stuff out to dry and we spentthe day alternating sleeping and we’d consume junk food. We were about sixtynautical miles from our destination and there was nothing we could do but relaxand wait for the wind. However, there was no way that we’d make it if we triedto round Tongatapu on the South end. We again changed our plan and changedcourse to go through the Northern shipping channel.In the back of my mind I had the thought lingering that the easterlies wouldpick up again soon, so we’d have to make landfall relatively soon or risk beingstuck just off the coast of Tonga for a few more days. Just before sunset we sawthe first land since we left New Zealand. This was very exciting and it liftedour morale to a new high. All the bad memories we had quickly faded away. Itfelt like we’ve almost made it! By now the winds had picked up and we keptreefing in order to slow Taleisin down enough so that we will arrive at thechannel entrance at day break. We had shifted our watch by an hour and startedplanning how we could each get a good rest before we made landfall. This wentwell for a little bit, then we lost the wind again completely. We continued todrift. From the forecasts we knew that we had till around mid day before theeasterlies pick up again and we might get stuck again.This was a problem! At 1 am when I woke Annie up I had already attached the Autopilot and got everything ready to make an attempt at getting the outboard on. Wehad thirty four nautical miles left to go, the water was clam enough and we knowfrom experience that this is do-able with our outboard. We managed to get theoutboard attached without much drama. But the million dollar question was, willit start. We were fully prepared to make landfall under sail alone if we had to,but the thought of being stuck out on the water for another three days orpossibly a week was a bit much to bear. I pulled the starter cord on the motor,puff puff puff. I pulled the choke out, the motor grunts and stops. I gave itanother pull but with the throttle open a bit. It started! I let it run fora bit to get itself warmed up.We put the motor in gear and opened the throttle just enough to push us justfast enough to allow us to reach the channel entrance at day break. We set theauto pilot on course and it seemed like we had a real chance at making landfall.I went down below to get two hours of sleep before I would swap with Annie. Mynext watch I spent sitting in the cockpit, my spirits high and I was watchingTonga slowly rise out of the ocean! I know we’re not there yet, but it sure feltlike we had arrived! I decided that I’d let Annie sleep as long as I could andthen we’d start the process of actively handling the boat to make our way in.Annie awoke on her own and joined me up on deck. We both sat there in awe asmore and more of Tonga appeared. We both kept saying that if feels like we’vemade it, but we didn’t want to celebrate prematurely! One and half hours laterwe decided to attempt to make contact with the port authority, customs etc. Butit was Sunday. Tonga is closed on Sundays. We tried a few times and then decidedto go anchor at nearby island Pangaimotu. We dropped our hook at midday.Ignoring the one hour timezone difference, that makes a midday to midday run.Twenty days at sea! We made it. Sure we haven’t checked in yet, but our anchoris down and we can now relax.We now had cell phone reception and were able to active roaming on my phone. Weproceeded to call our families. We had purposefully not told them what we wereup to, as to spare them the worrying that they would have to do while we’resailing. This in hindsight was a good choice as it took us much longer thanexpected. Sure we had a means of communication, but as it proved we lost ourability to charge our battery for a few days, which meant that we could havelost communication with them. This in turn would have just made them worry more.Taleisin is still the exact same unstoppable boat that Lin and Larry made. Wemight have added a few supplemental things here and there but we have only addedto the available options. We’ve never reduced methods of achieving things. Wecould completely have made the journey without electricity. We could havecompleted the journey without the outboard.We were quite relieved and surprised by the reactions we got from our families.Sure they had moments which nearly gave them heart attacks when we told themwhat we had just accomplished. But in the end they congratulated us and wereproud of our achievement! We got a lot of questions about things that seem quiteinsignificant to us, we’ve been planning this for quite some time and hadcertainly done our homework before we set off. After answering a lot ofquestions they were finally satisfied and relieved that we had managed to dowhat we did. We explained to them that we endured three storms, so the trip backshouldn’t be more challenging as we’d be doing exactly the same things we hadjust done if things got worse. We are now capable of handling the boat in allconditions so they should be comfortable with the prospect of us returning toNew Zealand.It’s been a long and hard journey to get to this point. We have had manyobstacles, but we’ve had many people encourage us along the way. Many peoplealso thought us crazy, they might be right. Ultimately we told very few peoplewhen we actually left, just in case we had to turn back. We’re going to claimthat we crossed the ocean engine free. Sure we used the outboard a little at thestart and a bit more at the end. We didn’t have the luxury of using an enginewhen becalmed or to try and out run those storms! We couldn’t use the engine atall on the open ocean. Some of you might disagree with our claim, that’s fine.We’re extremely proud of our accomplishment regardless.I’d like to finish by quoting Kaci Cronkhite in a comment on our post onFacebook: “You did it! In a boat built to do so… to take two dreamers, darers,lovers… to sea”. We had learned to sail on this little boat, it wasn’t easyand ultimately used her for what she was built. Taleisin has truly started hernew life with a new crew, she sails the seas again!We’d like to thank those we let in on our plans from the start for their supportand encouragement, as well as keeping it quiet so that we wouldn’t cause ourloved ones to worry for five years. Without your help and encouragement we mightnever have been able to make this journey!Oh and for those wondering about the chicken soup… Well we intended to use itfor burley around day 15 or so, but putting out a fishing line was a luxury thatwe couldn’t afford, so the fish got a free feed.">

    <meta itemprop="description" content="This is part three of a three part post, see partsone andtwo first if youhaven’t read them.I read somewhere that luck on a boat is created by placing luck tokens ina black box. You cannot see how many tokens are in the box and you never knowhow many you use (the assumption is all of them). You place these tokens inthere by doing preventative maintenance. Every time you fix something smallthat’s not quite ready to be done you add a token. It’s essential to add as manytokens as you can because you don’t know how many is in the box. When things gosideways out on the open ocean you make a withdrawal from that box, you neverknow how much you withdraw since you don’t know how much is in there. But thatis where luck comes from. The little string I replaced caused the cotter pin tostick around, it was lucky since I could have lost it. We certainly made a fewwithdrawals! This is also the reason I went to fix the hatch, who knows whatthat might have prevented.We continued on our way. The wind was such that we couldn’t sail East. We headedtowards Minerva reef. This is fine as we know there’s a wind shift coming. Itwas around this point that we realized we’d reached the point of no return.A good friend of mine describes commitment with the following analogy. If youconsider bacon and eggs.

Seethe blog post at http://www.taleisin.com/crossing-an-ocean-part-3/ (will beposted shortly) A post shared by  Annie Ryan(@svtaleisin) on Aug 29, 2019 at 9:03pmPDTBob sent us a message asking how things were going since he hadn’t heard fromus. It was late at night and I replied immediately, he must not have gotten ittill the next day. His reply the next morning was, “I was hoping you’d befurther East, you’re close to Minerva, anchor there and leave in two days time.The wind is not in your favor!”Bugger, Bob, we’re sixty three nautical miles North of Minerva already; that’sa long way to go back! That’s OK just heave to for the night and carry on in themorning then, he replied. Well heaving to is not an option right now, it wouldbe more uncomfortable due to the confusion on the seas and the wind is notblowing enough to help out. We decided to push on but slow Taleisin down toa crawl. North is still progress towards our goal so we’ll wait for the shift.We spent the next two days waiting for the shift. We didn’t realize that thesixteen knot current flowing East would actually prevent us from sailing eastcompletely. The wind was blowing from the east and this caused two meter chop toform. We could sail North and South, but absolutely not East! We spent the nexttwo days doing just that. It’s around this time that the reality of the mentalchallenge came home for me. Little things started getting to me. I was up on thebowsprit trying to take the jib down. I got dunked in the water when thebowsprit went under. I was wearing my foul weather gear and, of course, my bootsfilled with water. It’s not the first time this has happened. But I had beencomplaining about the fact that my foul weather gear is more akin to fairweather gear. I get completely soaked if the conditions get a bit rougher. Theydidn’t keep me dry and would stay wet for days. The issue was most likelyrelated to the amount of salt that had soaked into them by now. If I sat in thecockpit when it was wet the water would quickly soak through.It got to the point where I stripped down completely before donning my foulweather gear as I was going to get wet. This caused me to be wet and cold everytime I had to go up in less than ideal conditions, which seemed constantly to meat this point. I had a minor meltdown. Annie growled at me to get my acttogether and get on with the task so I can get down below.After three days of not making progress it seemed like we were going to be stuckin limbo for ever. Turning back was not an option and moving forward wasimpossible. Lets just say that our morale was a little bit low at this point.Annie started digging out some comfort food. While she was provisioning shewould stash away little treats especially for me. I tend not to go for comfortfood as much, but she must have known that there will come a point in time whereI’d need it. She’d gone above and beyond and stashed quite a bit away. Shebrought it all out and laid out a Smörgåsbord of chocolate in front of me. Shealso pulled out a tin of BBQ Pringles. If there was no other reason to love her,this would be reason enough alone! It did wonders for my low morale! At the timewe still had two hundred and sixty five nautical miles to go before we reachedVava’u.Annie woke me up at midnight to change watch. We spent a bit of time discussinga change of plan to make landfall at Tongatapu instead. We both needed to ‘getsomewhere’ desperately. I spent my shift planning a new route and it looked likewe might be able to make landfall much sooner. Finally at 3:30 am the windsshifted. Annie changed course! We were elated that we managed to get a break. Wewere heading South East, but that didn’t matter we were heading East! Bobsuggested that we keep that course and round Tongatapu on the Southern end andmake landfall once the winds shift. We kept pushing through the night andthought that we might actually have a shot at making landfall in the nearfuture.The next day we lost the wind. We were drifting towards Tonga but we certainlyweren’t sailing. As much as that might sound painful it was actually a nicechange. We got to relax all day, the weather was nice and we managed to recoversome much needed energy! Annie put a lot of wet stuff out to dry and we spentthe day alternating sleeping and we’d consume junk food. We were about sixtynautical miles from our destination and there was nothing we could do but relaxand wait for the wind. However, there was no way that we’d make it if we triedto round Tongatapu on the South end. We again changed our plan and changedcourse to go through the Northern shipping channel.In the back of my mind I had the thought lingering that the easterlies wouldpick up again soon, so we’d have to make landfall relatively soon or risk beingstuck just off the coast of Tonga for a few more days. Just before sunset we sawthe first land since we left New Zealand. This was very exciting and it liftedour morale to a new high. All the bad memories we had quickly faded away. Itfelt like we’ve almost made it! By now the winds had picked up and we keptreefing in order to slow Taleisin down enough so that we will arrive at thechannel entrance at day break. We had shifted our watch by an hour and startedplanning how we could each get a good rest before we made landfall. This wentwell for a little bit, then we lost the wind again completely. We continued todrift. From the forecasts we knew that we had till around mid day before theeasterlies pick up again and we might get stuck again.This was a problem! At 1 am when I woke Annie up I had already attached the Autopilot and got everything ready to make an attempt at getting the outboard on. Wehad thirty four nautical miles left to go, the water was clam enough and we knowfrom experience that this is do-able with our outboard. We managed to get theoutboard attached without much drama. But the million dollar question was, willit start. We were fully prepared to make landfall under sail alone if we had to,but the thought of being stuck out on the water for another three days orpossibly a week was a bit much to bear. I pulled the starter cord on the motor,puff puff puff. I pulled the choke out, the motor grunts and stops. I gave itanother pull but with the throttle open a bit. It started! I let it run fora bit to get itself warmed up.We put the motor in gear and opened the throttle just enough to push us justfast enough to allow us to reach the channel entrance at day break. We set theauto pilot on course and it seemed like we had a real chance at making landfall.I went down below to get two hours of sleep before I would swap with Annie. Mynext watch I spent sitting in the cockpit, my spirits high and I was watchingTonga slowly rise out of the ocean! I know we’re not there yet, but it sure feltlike we had arrived! I decided that I’d let Annie sleep as long as I could andthen we’d start the process of actively handling the boat to make our way in.Annie awoke on her own and joined me up on deck. We both sat there in awe asmore and more of Tonga appeared. We both kept saying that if feels like we’vemade it, but we didn’t want to celebrate prematurely! One and half hours laterwe decided to attempt to make contact with the port authority, customs etc. Butit was Sunday. Tonga is closed on Sundays. We tried a few times and then decidedto go anchor at nearby island Pangaimotu. We dropped our hook at midday.Ignoring the one hour timezone difference, that makes a midday to midday run.Twenty days at sea! We made it. Sure we haven’t checked in yet, but our anchoris down and we can now relax.We now had cell phone reception and were able to active roaming on my phone. Weproceeded to call our families. We had purposefully not told them what we wereup to, as to spare them the worrying that they would have to do while we’resailing. This in hindsight was a good choice as it took us much longer thanexpected. Sure we had a means of communication, but as it proved we lost ourability to charge our battery for a few days, which meant that we could havelost communication with them. This in turn would have just made them worry more.Taleisin is still the exact same unstoppable boat that Lin and Larry made. Wemight have added a few supplemental things here and there but we have only addedto the available options. We’ve never reduced methods of achieving things. Wecould completely have made the journey without electricity. We could havecompleted the journey without the outboard.We were quite relieved and surprised by the reactions we got from our families.Sure they had moments which nearly gave them heart attacks when we told themwhat we had just accomplished. But in the end they congratulated us and wereproud of our achievement! We got a lot of questions about things that seem quiteinsignificant to us, we’ve been planning this for quite some time and hadcertainly done our homework before we set off. After answering a lot ofquestions they were finally satisfied and relieved that we had managed to dowhat we did. We explained to them that we endured three storms, so the trip backshouldn’t be more challenging as we’d be doing exactly the same things we hadjust done if things got worse. We are now capable of handling the boat in allconditions so they should be comfortable with the prospect of us returning toNew Zealand.It’s been a long and hard journey to get to this point. We have had manyobstacles, but we’ve had many people encourage us along the way. Many peoplealso thought us crazy, they might be right. Ultimately we told very few peoplewhen we actually left, just in case we had to turn back. We’re going to claimthat we crossed the ocean engine free. Sure we used the outboard a little at thestart and a bit more at the end. We didn’t have the luxury of using an enginewhen becalmed or to try and out run those storms! We couldn’t use the engine atall on the open ocean. Some of you might disagree with our claim, that’s fine.We’re extremely proud of our accomplishment regardless.I’d like to finish by quoting Kaci Cronkhite in a comment on our post onFacebook: “You did it! In a boat built to do so… to take two dreamers, darers,lovers… to sea”. We had learned to sail on this little boat, it wasn’t easyand ultimately used her for what she was built. Taleisin has truly started hernew life with a new crew, she sails the seas again!We’d like to thank those we let in on our plans from the start for their supportand encouragement, as well as keeping it quiet so that we wouldn’t cause ourloved ones to worry for five years. Without your help and encouragement we mightnever have been able to make this journey!Oh and for those wondering about the chicken soup… Well we intended to use itfor burley around day 15 or so, but putting out a fishing line was a luxury thatwe couldn’t afford, so the fish got a free feed.">

<p>I read somewhere that luck on a boat is created by placing luck tokens in
a black box. You cannot see how many tokens are in the box and you never know

sideways out on the open ocean you make a withdrawal from that box, you never
know how much you withdraw since you don’t know how much is in there. But that
is where luck comes from. The little string I replaced caused the cotter pin to
stick around, it was lucky since I could have lost it. We certainly made a few
withdrawals! This is also the reason I went to fix the hatch, who knows what
that might have prevented.</p>

<p>We continued on our way. The wind was such that we couldn’t sail East. We headed
towards Minerva reef. This is fine as we know there’s a wind shift coming. It
was around this point that we realized we’d reached the point of no return.
A good friend of mine describes commitment with the following analogy. If you
consider bacon and eggs. The chicken was involved in the breakfast, but the pig
was committed. We realized that we were the pig in this scenario. We cannot turn
back since we’d have to repeat everything we’d just come through, we have to
carry on!</p>

<p>Bob sent us a message asking how things were going since he hadn’t heard from
us. It was late at night and I replied immediately, he must not have gotten it
till the next day. His reply the next morning was, “I was hoping you’d be
further East, you’re close to Minerva, anchor there and leave in two days time.
The wind is not in your favor!”</p>

<p>Bugger, Bob, we’re sixty three nautical miles North of Minerva already; that’s
a long way to go back! That’s OK just heave to for the night and carry on in the
morning then, he replied. Well heaving to is not an option right now, it would
be more uncomfortable due to the confusion on the seas and the wind is not
blowing enough to help out. We decided to push on but slow Taleisin down to
a crawl. North is still progress towards our goal so we’ll wait for the shift.</p>

<p>We spent the next two days waiting for the shift. We didn’t realize that the
sixteen knot current flowing East would actually prevent us from sailing east
completely. The wind was blowing from the east and this caused two meter chop to
form. We could sail North and South, but absolutely not East! We spent the next
two days doing just that. It’s around this time that the reality of the mental
challenge came home for me. Little things started getting to me. I was up on the
bowsprit trying to take the jib down. I got dunked in the water when the
bowsprit went under. I was wearing my foul weather gear and, of course, my boots
filled with water. It’s not the first time this has happened. But I had been
complaining about the fact that my foul weather gear is more akin to fair
weather gear. I get completely soaked if the conditions get a bit rougher. They
didn’t keep me dry and would stay wet for days. The issue was most likely
related to the amount of salt that had soaked into them by now. If I sat in the
cockpit when it was wet the water would quickly soak through.</p>

<p>It got to the point where I stripped down completely before donning my foul
weather gear as I was going to get wet. This caused me to be wet and cold every
time I had to go up in less than ideal conditions, which seemed constantly to me
at this point. I had a minor meltdown. Annie growled at me to get my act
together and get on with the task so I can get down below.</p>

<p>After three days of not making progress it seemed like we were going to be stuck
in limbo for ever. Turning back was not an option and moving forward was
impossible. Lets just say that our morale was a little bit low at this point.
Annie started digging out some comfort food. While she was provisioning she
would stash away little treats especially for me. I tend not to go for comfort
food as much, but she must have known that there will come a point in time where
I’d need it. She’d gone above and beyond and stashed quite a bit away. She
brought it all out and laid out a Smörgåsbord of chocolate in front of me. She
also pulled out a tin of BBQ Pringles. If there was no other reason to love her,
this would be reason enough alone! It did wonders for my low morale! At the time
we still had two hundred and sixty five nautical miles to go before we reached
Vava’u.</p>

<p>Annie woke me up at midnight to change watch. We spent a bit of time discussing
a change of plan to make landfall at Tongatapu instead. We both needed to ‘get
somewhere’ desperately. I spent my shift planning a new route and it looked like
we might be able to make landfall much sooner. Finally at 3:30 am the winds
shifted. Annie changed course! We were elated that we managed to get a break. We
were heading South East, but that didn’t matter we were heading East! Bob
suggested that we keep that course and round Tongatapu on the Southern end and
make landfall once the winds shift. We kept pushing through the night and
thought that we might actually have a shot at making landfall in the near
future.</p>

<p>The next day we lost the wind. We were drifting towards Tonga but we certainly
weren’t sailing. As much as that might sound painful it was actually a nice
change. We got to relax all day, the weather was nice and we managed to recover
some much needed energy! Annie put a lot of wet stuff out to dry and we spent
the day alternating sleeping and we’d consume junk food. We were about sixty
nautical miles from our destination and there was nothing we could do but relax
and wait for the wind. However, there was no way that we’d make it if we tried
to round Tongatapu on the South end. We again changed our plan and changed
course to go through the Northern shipping channel.</p>

<p>In the back of my mind I had the thought lingering that the easterlies would
pick up again soon, so we’d have to make landfall relatively soon or risk being
stuck just off the coast of Tonga for a few more days. Just before sunset we saw
the first land since we left New Zealand. This was very exciting and it lifted
our morale to a new high. All the bad memories we had quickly faded away. It
felt like we’ve almost made it! By now the winds had picked up and we kept
reefing in order to slow Taleisin down enough so that we will arrive at the
channel entrance at day break. We had shifted our watch by an hour and started
planning how we could each get a good rest before we made landfall. This went
well for a little bit, then we lost the wind again completely. We continued to
drift. From the forecasts we knew that we had till around mid day before the
easterlies pick up again and we might get stuck again.</p>

<p>This was a problem! At 1 am when I woke Annie up I had already attached the Auto
pilot and got everything ready to make an attempt at getting the outboard on. We
had thirty four nautical miles left to go, the water was clam enough and we know
from experience that this is do-able with our outboard. We managed to get the
outboard attached without much drama. But the million dollar question was, will
it start. We were fully prepared to make landfall under sail alone if we had to,
but the thought of being stuck out on the water for another three days or
possibly a week was a bit much to bear. I pulled the starter cord on the motor,
puff puff puff. I pulled the choke out, the motor grunts and stops. I gave it
another pull but with the throttle open a bit. It started! I let it run for
a bit to get itself warmed up.</p>

<p>We put the motor in gear and opened the throttle just enough to push us just
fast enough to allow us to reach the channel entrance at day break. We set the
auto pilot on course and it seemed like we had a real chance at making landfall.
I went down below to get two hours of sleep before I would swap with Annie. My
next watch I spent sitting in the cockpit, my spirits high and I was watching
Tonga slowly rise out of the ocean! I know we’re not there yet, but it sure felt
like we had arrived! I decided that I’d let Annie sleep as long as I could and
then we’d start the process of actively handling the boat to make our way in.</p>

<p>Annie awoke on her own and joined me up on deck. We both sat there in awe as
more and more of Tonga appeared. We both kept saying that if feels like we’ve
made it, but we didn’t want to celebrate prematurely! One and half hours later
we decided to attempt to make contact with the port authority, customs etc. But
it was Sunday. Tonga is closed on Sundays. We tried a few times and then decided
to go anchor at nearby island Pangaimotu. We dropped our hook at midday.
Ignoring the one hour timezone difference, that makes a midday to midday run.
Twenty days at sea! We made it. Sure we haven’t checked in yet, but our anchor
is down and we can now relax.</p>

<p>We now had cell phone reception and were able to active roaming on my phone. We
proceeded to call our families. We had purposefully not told them what we were
up to, as to spare them the worrying that they would have to do while we’re
sailing. This in hindsight was a good choice as it took us much longer than
expected. Sure we had a means of communication, but as it proved we lost our
ability to charge our battery for a few days, which meant that we could have
lost communication with them. This in turn would have just made them worry more.
Taleisin is still the exact same unstoppable boat that Lin and Larry made. We
might have added a few supplemental things here and there but we have only added
to the available options. We’ve never reduced methods of achieving things. We
could completely have made the journey without electricity. We could have
completed the journey without the outboard.</p>

<p>We were quite relieved and surprised by the reactions we got from our families.
Sure they had moments which nearly gave them heart attacks when we told them
what we had just accomplished. But in the end they congratulated us and were
proud of our achievement! We got a lot of questions about things that seem quite
insignificant to us, we’ve been planning this for quite some time and had
certainly done our homework before we set off. After answering a lot of
questions they were finally satisfied and relieved that we had managed to do
what we did. We explained to them that we endured three storms, so the trip back
shouldn’t be more challenging as we’d be doing exactly the same things we had
just done if things got worse. We are now capable of handling the boat in all
conditions so they should be comfortable with the prospect of us returning to
New Zealand.</p>

<p>It’s been a long and hard journey to get to this point. We have had many
obstacles, but we’ve had many people encourage us along the way. Many people
also thought us crazy, they might be right. Ultimately we told very few people
when we actually left, just in case we had to turn back. We’re going to claim
that we crossed the ocean engine free. Sure we used the outboard a little at the
start and a bit more at the end. We didn’t have the luxury of using an engine
when becalmed or to try and out run those storms! We couldn’t use the engine at
all on the open ocean. Some of you might disagree with our claim, that’s fine.
We’re extremely proud of our accomplishment regardless.</p>

<p>I’d like to finish by quoting Kaci Cronkhite in a comment on our post on
Facebook: “You did it! In a boat built to do so… to take two dreamers, darers,
lovers… to sea”. We had learned to sail on this little boat, it wasn’t easy
and ultimately used her for what she was built. Taleisin has truly started her
new life with a new crew, she sails the seas again!</p>

<p>We’d like to thank those we let in on our plans from the start for their support
and encouragement, as well as keeping it quiet so that we wouldn’t cause our
loved ones to worry for five years. Without your help and encouragement we might
never have been able to make this journey!</p>

<p>Oh and for those wondering about the chicken soup… Well we intended to use it
for burley around day 15 or so, but putting out a fishing line was a luxury that
we couldn’t afford, so the fish got a free feed.</p>
