        "title": "Sailing Taleisin for the First Time",
        "excerpt":"This story begins early the previous morning. We had to drive 1 hour to Sandspitto catch the  ferry which would drop us  off on the Pardey’s jetty.  Once we gotthere we  rowed out to Taleisin  like we have done  a few times in  the past. Weloaded our personal belongings onto Taleisin, only what we needed to survive forthe next 2 days. This meant we had some food and warm clothes should the weatherrequire it.After loading our personal belongings on the boat we spent some time with Lin inthe boat  workshop. She  spent quite a  while explaining what  all the  bits andpieces are that we should be loading onto  Taleisin. There was a big pile of it,I remember asking Lin where it would all  fit. Lin assured me that it’s all beenon Taleisin and that she will swallow it without any issues. After going througheverything in  detail we began the  long day of ferrying  everything to Taleisinvia Cheeky2. I  had a discussion with Lin about  the weather forecastas some heavy weather was forecast for  the afternoon. We decided that we’ll setsail early  in the morning  and we should hopefully  beat the bad  weather, it’sonly about 30 nautical miles to sail. Loading Taleisin took a very long and timewe were absolutely exhausted as we finished the last load in the dark.We got  up as early  as we could  manage, had a  quick breakfast and  started toprepare Taleisin  to set sail. I  rigged up a GoPro  and set it to  record whilethis was going on.  Underestimating the battery life on the GoPro  it ran out ofpower long before things got exciting. Below  is an edit of some of the footage,there’s not much going on but it will give you an idea of what was going on.Something to keep in mind, Annie and I  have never sailed a big boat on our own.We’ve had some  sailing lessons, been on  a couple of sailing  trips with peoplewho are experienced. That was about the  extent of our sailing experience on bigboats. I’m  very fortunate  that my  day job  requires me  to learn  things veryquickly, retain them, and put them to use almost immediately. This skill came invery handy when it was time to sail  Taleisin out of the cove. Taleisin does nothave an engine, this  means there’s a bonus challenge when  it comes to sailing,everything must be done under sail or via sculling oar. Given that at this pointI’ve never sculled a boat in my life, we’re sailing off the mooring.It  was very  calm in  the morning  and hardly  any wind  in the  cove. Once  weprepared Taleisin, I asked  Annie if she’d prefer to be on the  helm or drop themooring line. She opted  to drop the mooring line as  it was less responsibilityand something she felt was easier to do.We stored  cheeky2 on deck, hoisted  the sails, tucked a  reef in themain and Annie  went forward to drop  the mooring line. I pulled  the sheets in,pulled the tiller over,  took a deep breath… thinking “here  we go”! The sailsfilled gently  Taleisin picked  up enough  way and we  started moving.  I recallAnnie asking, so when  do we start sailing? My response  was, we’re sailing now,it’s just very slow, but we’re sailing!We slowly weaved our way through all the moored boats and eventually made it outof the  cove. We  decided the previous  night that we’d  sail through  the innerchannel as it seemed like it might be more sheltered in case the weather pick upas there was a  few islands that might provide some  protection from the rougherseas. We had a glorious morning of  easy sailing, the winds were light the waterwas smooth. I remember thinking, this is  what life should be all about! Sailingis slow  going, it’s  great if  you don’t  have to  be anywhere  in a  hurry! Weremoved the reef from the main and hoisted the big jib instead of the staysail.Once we sailed  past Motuora Island things  started to get a  bit more exciting.The wind has slowly increased and we  haven’t noticed as we’ve been running withit the whole way. The waves started to  build. We don’t agree on the exact hightof  the waves,  but they  were sufficiently  big enough  to cause  Annie to  getseasick. The swell was  beam on, at no point did we feel  in danger so we didn’tchange course. Taleisin was just taking this all in her stride. Annie spent sometime  hanging over  the lee  rail.  She eventually  recovered and  we sailed  ontowards the Whagaparoa passage.At this point We  changed course towards long bay, the swell  was now pushing usalong and Taleisin  was surfing the waves -  this is a LOT of  fun. Taleisin wasvery stable during  this whole experience! After  doing a bit of  fun sailing werealised that  we should probably  sail around Devenport.  I went down  below tograb the ipad to verify our position and  check out the charts on it. Due to thesea state I rushed  back up on deck and I turned green  very quickly. Now it wasmy turn to hang over the lee rail for over an hour. Annie did a fantastic job atthe helm while I recovered. At this point we’re sailing towards Rangitoto Islandwith the intention of jibing once we pass Devenport. It will be an easy run intothe marina.Once we  got to Devenport  I said to  Annie, lets Jibe!  So we went  through theprocedure, started to jibe… That’s when I realised that the wind was blowing alot stronger than we  realised. All of a sudden the heel was  far more than wewere comfortable. I yelled let the sheets go!  Annie let the jib sheet go, I letthe main sheet go, I pulled the helm  hard over, Taleisin came back up right andI pointed her  into the wind. I yelled  out to Annie, get on the  helm, keep herinto the wind, I’m changing sails and reefing the main.I went  forward, dropped  the jib,  dropped the main,  put a  reef in  the main,hoisted the main and hoisted the staysail.  That felt much better, less sail wasa lot more manageable. Later we learned that the wind was 30kts gusting 35kts. Itook the tiller, let Taleisin drop off and we started to sail again.From here  on out  the sailing was  actually pretty easy  going. While  about 30minutes away  from the marina  I called  the marina up  asking the push  boat toassist us getting into  our marina berth. I was advised to radio  once we get inand they will come and tie up next to  us. When we got to the marina entrance werounded up into the wind, I dropped  the head sail, tucked another reef into themain. This was when I had the most expensive accident for the day, the jib sheetknocked my sun glasses off my head and  I watched them sink to the bottom of theharbour  - I  had a  fleeting  thought about  jumping  in after  them, but  thenrealised that it was probably a very bad idea. I yelled some expletives (see I’ma real sailor now) and sailed into the marina.Once we entered the marina I got onto the radio and the marina boat met us abouthalf way down the channel. They tied up next to us and we dropped the main sail.I made the mistake of thinking that the  push boat crew would know what they aredealing with. Things  got really exciting as they didn’t  realise just how heavyTaleisin is. We  had a few near  misses with other boats, but  eventually we gotTaleisin all tied up. We sat down for a couple of minutes to regain composure.We went  down below, I grabbed  my phone and gave  Lin a call “Your  baby is alltied up in Westhaven, all safe and sound”. I recanted some of the adventures andI could sense  that she was relieved  that we made it without  anything major gowrong.We learnt more during  that one trip than we did during a  whole week’s worth ofsailing  lessons. We  had  to respond  quickly,  we  had to  think  on our  feet(something  I’m fortunately  used to  due to  my day  job). More  importantly welearnt that if things  go wrong get yourself into a position  where you can slowdown, think, regroup and solve the problem.It would be remiss  of me if I didn’t point out that  this story mostly reflectsthe abilities of Taleisin and not that of  our own. I’m convinced that if it wasa lesser boat,  things would not have  been so smooth. We are  indeed very proudcare takers of this well found vessel.Lin       Pardey       wrote       her       side       of       the       storyhere.","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"Learning to sail a  boat like Taleisin is challenging at  best, learning to sailon a boat like Taleisin takes things up a notch! Training wheels! That’s what weneed!  While  Taleisin has  got  a  perfectly good  lead  line  on board  (stillfunctioning as well  as the day the  Pardeys installed it), we’ve  got plenty toget right  without the worry  about how deep the  water is. Enter  the RaymarineDragonfly 4 Pro, now don’t get me  wrong, there’s no substitute for common senseand we  fully intend  on moving to  old school navigation  and old  school depthsounding. Baby steps are normally the way to start, jumping in the deep end witha boat like Taleisin provides plenty  of challenge without the added bits aroundthe edges.So after spending  some time searching around  and scratching my head  I came upwith this little design. It’s a 25mm PVC  pipe with a 20mm dowel shoved down theinside. It’s a prototype, the idea is  that the dowel prevents the flex, and PVCis pretty well suited  to being in water. I still need to  seal the bottom of itusing some  silicon or epoxy or  what ever will do  the job. It should  be quiteobvious  to  the  observer that  we  don’t  intend  on  putting a  through  hulltransducer on  Taleisin and  that this  is just a  “portable” sounder  and chartplotter.Lashing the pipe to the transom as  a temporary measure, I will do this slightlybetter before I take it out for a test sail.I fashioned  some form of  plug and  play system using  an existing 12V  plug inTaleisin. We’re  not very keen  on altering  Taleisin without having  thought itthrough properly. This allows me to play and if I choose to throw it out, nobodywill know any better (well maybe they will  if they read this post). I guess I’mtrying to say that the boat will not be harmed with this little experiment.As an added little bonus, it’s got  a GPS chart plotter for added entertainment.This will provide  a makeshift set of instrumentation for  speed, depth and GPS.While I could have  used an iPad - and I thought about  it, using some wifi typetransducer with the Navionics app. This would  have left me with the small issuethat it’s not waterproof. After doing a lot of reading I ended up going with thedragonfly instead, added bonus is that I can connect the iPad via wifi and stillhave a larger  screen. I also think I  might get better battery life  out of thedragonfly than the iPad, but time will tell!How will all  of this work out?  I have no idea,  but if it works  it will allowsome training wheels  during the early stages.  Once we get up  to standard withour skills it wont matter any more.","categories": [],

        "title": "Moving Day...",
        "excerpt":"We woke  up in the  morning, I said  to Annie “if  we’re going to  move Taleisintoday, we better get going. Not much wind  but it will pick up later today”. Youmight  wonder, move  Taleisin where?  Taleisin has  been sitting  snugly in  themarina all winter, as you might imagine  getting an 8 ton engineless boat out ofa marina can be a little challenging. We have recently had a new mooring laid ina spot that’s easy to sail on and off. This is where Taleisin is moving to.We’ve had some previous attempts at getting  out of the marina, one didn’t go towell and the other  turned into a warping practice run. I  might write about thefirst attempt one day  but the bruises are still visible on my  ego. In short, Iended up in the water and I drowned an outboard.So in  preparation for our adventure,  we prepared Taleisin for  sailing, talkedthrough our plan, had  a disagreement, came to an agreement  and we were finallyready to  give it a  “go”. We did  all of this in  just 2 hours.  Given previousexperience I’d be lying if I said that  I wasn’t nervous, but I had to hide thisfrom Annie as it would make her more nervous, she was already not that confidentin my ability  to pull this little stunt  off. Not being one to shy  away from achallenge, I just  dragged my feet for  a little bit building up  the courage togive it a go.Some people have  asked me in the past  how we deal with the lack  of an engine,here’s the current way of doing things:  Warp out of the berth  strap the dingy to the quarter  barge outNotice the warp lines around the pilings.We pulled her out slowly using the mooring lines (not in the diagram).Annie was in  the cockpit pulling on the  stern line to turn the boat.  I was onthe bow pulling the boat closer to avoid the bow sprit hitting the pilings. Thiswas something that happened the first time we tried to warp out.It’s worth noting that the direction the boat is pointing in is the direction ofthe channel. We tied the dingy to the hip and barged out.So it’s worth noting  a few things that we learned from  this. Firstly we warpedher  out really  well, it  felt great!  However,  do not  put the  dingy on  theopposite side of the  pilings. While there’s no way on, the  dingy will push theboat  into  the  pilings (there  was  no  wind  to  push us  off  the  pilings).Consequently we had a lot of fending to do, this is hard work if you’re moving aheavy boat.  Once you have  way on (and Taleisin  doesn’t need much),  it’s veryeasy to  move the boat  in this manner!  The original plan  was to push  off thepilings and drift into the middle of the channel, unfortunately this didn’t workout. Next time I’d get the dingy between the boat the and pilings (still need tofigure out how we’d go about this).A few gut busting  seconds later Taleisin was moving fast  enough for the rudderto be effective! I  looked at Annie raised a fist in the  air and said, the hardpart  is over!  Annie obviously  didn’t  share my  victory  as we  still had  tonavigate our way out of the marina and into the harbour.Finally making it out  of the marina, Annie commented how she’s  very glad to beout of the marina as it’s  been nothing but unpleasant boating experience insideit. I can completely understand her point of view as it’s been super challengingand we kept getting beaten down by Taleisin.Our next  challenge was to hoist  the sails, luckily  we picked a day  with verylittle wind.  Annie went forward  and hoisted the main,  it didn’t seem  to moveus… The  next minute a  powerboat came speeding by  at what was  definitely inexcess of 12 knots (harbour limits). The wake nearly tipped the dingy and almostdrowned the outboard. I leapt over the life  lines and onto the dingy to keep itupright. We traveled  under motor a little  bit longer but the  power boats weretraveling way too fast and it felt like  we were inside a washing machine. I cutthe outboard and let the dingy trail  behind. I hoisted the staysail and went tosit in the cockpit.The ghetto sounder/chart plotter indicated that  we were traveling at 1-2 knots.Since it didn’t really  feel like we had much in the way  of steerage I can onlyassume that  the current  was pushing us  along. It was  interesting to  see howquickly Annie’s dislike for power boats grew as we were drifting, she’s a propersailor now!After drifting for a while and getting thrown around by power boat wakes for toolong Annie persuaded me  to put the dingy back on the  quarter and push Taleisintowards the mooring. Once I got the  dingy pushing along we actually saw 5 knotson the Dragonfly pro,  I’m guessing at least 1-2 of  those were current related.It’s worth noting that the outboard was  only at half throttle and only 8HP. Nowthat we were moving we were making great  progress, I also didn’t have to sit inthe dingy the whole way and could just steer with the rudder on Taleisin.Approaching the mooring I hopped into the dingy and slowed the engine down, whenwe got close enough I just let the engine idle and we kept moving slowly towardsthe buoy.  Pickup was a  breeze. There  was only one  problem, this was  not ourmooring. Since it’s a new mooring and we’ve never used it we didn’t know what tolook for. But the mooring number was not the number I was given.So rather  than panic  I got  the engine  pushing along  slowly again  and Anniesteered  us towards  another buoy.  We followed  the same  recipe as  before andpickup was very  easy again! We secured  Taleisin to the mooring and  had a highfive moment!So if  you’re reading  along and thinking  that’s the end  of the  adventure youwould be forgiven since  for most it probably would be. We’re  not most and thisis when we got seasick for no apparent reason. Taleisin was rolling quite a bit,we still can’t figure out why. I was telling myself to just push through and geteverything stashed  away and tidied  up. Annie lay down  on the foredeck  and itlooked like a good idea to me. We  spent about an hour just laying there feelingpretty horrible. I’d  get up from time to  time trying to keep on  working but Ididn’t have much luck.Eventually Annie felt well enough to get back  to work, when I got up to try andhelp I got instructed to lay back down as I was apparently not looking the best.Annie soldiered on like a champ and put Taleisin in order!We had  one task that  we needed to  do before we could  head for the  dock, getcheeky2 off her  chocks. I had a few attempts  at this and eventuallymanaged to get the  job done without going green completely!  Once this task wasdone we loaded up the dingy with everything we needed to take back with us, thenwe learnt something interesting….As soon  as we got on  the dingy the seasickness  was gone. Since the  motion ofthe  dingy  was  different to  the  motion  of  Taleisin  we felt  better,  nexttime  I’m getting  in  the dingy!  Motoring  back  to the  dock  we were  towingCheeky2,  eventually getting  back to  the  dock the  packing up  andloading the  car up  took a  while. Approximately  8 hours  after we  started wefinished by  stopping for lunch  on the  way back to  the marina to  collect ourmooring lines and other car.par error:Cannot justify.","categories": [],

        "title": "Mooring Under Sail",
        "excerpt":"We got  up early today  to go sailing  on Taleisin! We  loaded the car  with ourinflatable  training wheels  and made  our  way to  the dock.  We started  goingthrough the motions of assembling the ducky to transport us out to Taleisin. Thereason we  had to get up  early was to make  our way out to  Taleisin to collectanother life jacket. The extra life jacket  was for Bud, a classic sail maker inAuckland from  Nalder sails.  I’ve been  told thatBud is  an expert  in the field  of classic  sail making, he’s  an old  salt andabsolutely loves the classics.On board Taleisin  we started to get  her ready to go sailing,  undoing the sailcovers, running the sheets, putting the tiller in place, the usual things you dobefore you go sailing. Bud called to tell me he’s running a little late. We werefine with that  as we were just hanging  out on Taleisin and it was  a nice day.Unfortunately for us Taleisin is moored in a spot where the sea state is exactlyright to induce motion  sickness. Annie had already taken sea  legs and was justchilling out on the  foredeck, I on the other hand, had not  and started to feelthe effects of sea sickness setting. This  was mostly due to me playing with they-valve in the  galley for the drain.  Rookie mistake, I know.  The smell comingout of  it was  something awful  and made  my stomach  churn. Luckily  I’ve beenreading about this stuff and decided to get up on deck quickly. After some freshair I went down below looking for sea legs.You’ll have to use your imagination as I didn’t take any photos, but there I waslaying  down in  the cockpit  trying to  regain my  composure. At  this point  Ithought it  might be best if  I headed back to  the dock to gain  some stabilityback! I left  Annie on board Taleisin,  grabbed an extra life  jacket, jumped inthe ducky and went back to the dock.Sitting at  the dock things  were getting much better  quickly and I  forgot allabout  that nasty  y-valve incident.  While waiting  a couple  of young  sailorswalked up and  asked me if the dinghy  tied to the dock belonged to  me. After abit of conversation they explained how they went out for a sail the previous dayand the  tow rope on their  dinghy sheared through.  The offered to pay  me somemoney to  ferry them  to their  boat. I  politely declined  the offer  for money(seemed like it  would be bad karma  to accept money for  something this simple)and suggested that  if they just hang  around till Bud arrives  that I’ll gladlydrop them  off on  their yacht,  Pinch of  Salt. I  do have  to give  these guyscredit, they were about to swim out  to their yacht with all their provisions ona float. They would how ever have to swim back to the dock.Bud arrived, all for of us piled into  Ducky with all the provisions too. Off wewent! The crew  of Pinch of Salt was  happy once aboard and we  continued on ourway to Taleisin.Once on board Taleisin  we hanked on the jib. Bud asked me  if I wanted to leaveunder sail instead of  hip towing. My answer was “of  course”! Bud explained theprocedure and what he expected Taleisin  to do while we’re doing this. BasicallyTaleisin is so sea  kindly and well balanced that we hoisted  the main, cast themooring line off and  she just fell off the wind and we  were sailing under mainonly.Once we got outside  the mooring field we hoisted the stays’l  and she picked upspeed. The  jib on Taleisin is  on a separate  stay from the forestay,  this wasdone so that Lin  and Larry could deal with the jib without  having to go out onthe bowsprit while  rounding Cape Horn. We didn’t tighten  this properly becausethe mooring line  was over the rope gypsy  while we were moored. I  was having abit of fun  and games up on the bow  trying to sort this out while  under way. Ican say this, I’m very glad that Larry put 8 inch bulwarks all around Taleisin’sdeck, it certainly made life a LOT easier  on the bow. To add insult to injury Ididn’t sort  the down haul for  the jib out properly  so I was running  back andforth trying to  hoist the jib. After  screwing around for probably  a good 5-10minutes with this I finally managed to get the jib up!I went  back to the  cockpit, we sheeted  the jib in,  put Taleisin hard  on thewind. It was glorious! It’s the first time we’ve had Taleisin under full sail! Ihad the biggest grin on my face and so did Bud - not sure which of us was havingmore fun! Annie was  hanging out in the companion way for  most of the duration,only jumping out to help with sheets when we were tacking of gybing. While Annieis no stranger to adventure and extreme sports, she’s a much better rock climberthan I am,  she’s not comfortable on  the water at all. She  should be commendedfor agreeing  to buy  Taleisin and to  sail with me,  she is  absolutely amazingbecause she  will push  herself well out  of her comfort  zone and  perform muchbetter than I ever could.After tacking back and forth up wind Bud suggested we gybe and come up alongsideone of the old New Zealand America’s cup yachts. That was a bit of fun, but theyleft us behind rather quickly! Bud showed me how to get Taleisin to run downwindwing and wing. This will take some practice to do confidently!Before we knew it  we were back at the mooring field and  Bud was explaining howto come in under  sail. Bud made this look super easy! We  rounded up slowly andghosted onto the mooring buoy, I grabbed it  with the boat hook and then the funstarted!There was quite a bit more load on  the line than expected, I couldn’t just holdTaleisin in place, Annie came up to the  bow and asked if she could help. I saidget me a line so I can tie this damn thing off. Looking back I should have takena turn on something with the line and it would have been a lot less exciting! Wegot it  tied off. I put  a line through the  bow roller and around  the windlassrope gypsy. Bud and myself heaved the mooring  line up and we managed to tie theline through  the mooring  line’s loop.  We ended  up winching  the rest  in andeventually got the  mooring line secured. This was probably  the hardest part ofthe whole experience.With  all of  that  done we  tidied  Taleisin up  and  we spent  a  bit of  timediscussing  Taleisin’s new  sails. I  think  it’s safe  to say  that we’re  veryexcited about  the new sails, they  should look absolutely awesome  and Taleisinwill have more  of a classic look with  them than she does now. This  might be abit counter to what  Lin and Larry would have done, but I  don’t think they willmind too much, it’s all about making the old girl look really good!The dinghy ride back was not quite as good. I’m a pretty average dinghy helmsmanand got the  entire crew wet in the chop.  In spite of all of this  Bud was kindenough to  agree to mentor  us on how  to do things under  sail! This is  a hugerelief as doing things without an engine and learning that way is quite tough onyour own when you’re not entirely sure what you’re doing.In the coming months  Bud will produce new sails for Taleisin,  we’ll be sure totake some pictures of her with the new sails…","categories": [],

        "title": "Sailing in Cheeky",
        "excerpt":"“Let’s go sailing in the dinghy” was  the words that Annie uttered on a Saturdaymorning. The  weather was wonderful  and there  was not a  lot of wind.  She wasexcited about the prospect  of sailing in the dinghy. I  was thinking to myself,this is huge, Annie is pushing me to  go sailing. So we loaded the car up withCheeky’s oars and small 2.5hp outboard.Getting  cheeky launched  was quick  and easy  and  we were  on our  way out  toTaleisin in no time. You might be wondering why we’re going to Taleisin if we’redinghy sailing!?  The answer is simple,  of course, Cheeky’s mast,  rudder, dropboard, tiller and sail  is onboard Taleisin. Once we got  to Taleisin we grabbedeverything we needed to rig cheeky for sailing  and went back to the dock to righer up.When we got back to  the dock I spent a bit of time trying  to figure out how tomake this little boat  sail. Granted I don’t know much  about boats and sailing,it didn’t take much to figure out a way to get the pieces to fit so it can sail.I was quite surprised at the simplicity. Lin  once said to me that a sailboat isan  incredibly simple  machine, and  I  guess you  can be  excused for  thinkingotherwise looking at modern yachts loaded to the gunwales with complexity.So having the boat rigged up and ready to attempt to sail her I went back to thecar to store  the outboard motor. I returned  to the dock and we cast  off to gosailing. We had  a slight problem, no  wind. Don’t worry, Annie  said look thereare boats sailing out there, pointing to the harbor, lets just row out for a bituntil we can catch  a breeze. So Annie being the champ that  she is, grabbed theoars and started to  row us out! It didn’t take long before  the sail filled andwe started sailing.We were  moving slowly, but we  were moving. It  was very nice and  relaxing, wewent out into the channel of the harbor, tacked back and forth for about an hourand then we decided to head back for lunch. We slowly sailed through the mooringfield and back to  the dock. Annie asked if we should row  back to the dock, butme being as stubborn as a mule wanted to sail back. Slowly but surely we made itback to the  dock and gently docked  Cheeky under sail. It was  a small victory,but we  did dock under sail.  It certainly is  nothing like it would  be dockingTaleisin, but it was an achievement none the less.Photos weren’t high priority for us, here’s a couple of bad “selfies”.Safely back at the  dock we started to disassemble cheeky and  moved her back tothe dinghy rack. Where’s  the car keys, I asked Annie?  We looked everywhere forthe keys. We couldn’t find the car keys!  I asked around to see if anybody wouldknow where they might get handed in if anybody found them. I eventually get holdof  the on  site security  guard.  She was  a  lovely lady,  very friendly,  andhelpful.  After a  bit  of looking  around and  digging  through everything  thesecurity guard asked if she could call us  a tow truck to come and open the car,at  this point  I thought  I may  have locked  them in  the car  when I  put theoutboard away.With the tow  truck underway and me cursing  under my breath as to  how stupid Iam, I ran into the crew from Pinch  of Salt. I enquired as to the whereabouts oftheir  dinghy. Apparently  they  have located  it on  TradeMe  (the New  Zealandversion of E-Bay) and was trying to figure out how to get it back.The tow truck arrives,  the driver takes 3 seconds to open the  door. No keys inthe car, bugger! We paid the driver  the $80 fee for his services. What happenednext was unexpected and a nice surprise.  The driver offered to drive us home toget our spare key for the car. We quickly loaded everything into the car, lockedit up and accepted the kind offer with a smile!When we arrived home we had another challenge! The key to the house was attachedto the key for the car. We’re in luck we have a locksmith around the corner fromus,  a very  friendly guy  and  also a  sailor  (well this  is Auckland,  almosteverybody is a sailor).  I wondered over to see if he  was home. Slight problem,he was out fishing for the day, but his lovely wife suggested that their 18 yearold son  bring the  ladder around  and climb  through the  window we  left open.Success! We got inside, got the spare key and went back to the dock in our othercar.On our way  back to the dock Annie  suggested that we stop and get  a cold drinkand ice-cream for  the security guard that  was so helpful and  friendly. It wasnice to  put a smile on  her face and she  really appreciated it as  the sun wasbeating down.So naturally  after we  got home,  I posted  a little  about this  experience oncruisers forum. One  of the members pointed  out that it might  pay to sacrificesome coins  upfront to the  ocean as  it would appear  that I’m paying  for safepassage one way or another.We had a great time, and it was another adventure thanks to Taleisin.","categories": [],

        "title": "Ditching Work to Go Sailing...",
        "excerpt":"So you wake up in the morning, it’s  perfect weather, the wind is just enough tomove  the boat  at a  slow  pace. You  think  to yourself,  “excellent, lets  tosailing”. Suddenly you realise it’s Tuesday morning and you’re supposed to be atwork for meetings. So you make a decision….I did attend the required meetings and  told everybody in the office, that’s it,I’m going sailing  see you tomorrow! I  went home, had a quick  lunch and loadedDucky in the car. Annie and I were off to the dock…I’m very  fortunate that I can  at times have flexibility  around working hours,most of the time  we’re very busy and I have to keep  my nose to the grindstone.I’m working towards freeing more time up  for playing. Annie is a school teacherand she’s fortunately still on holiday.We’re becoming  more efficient at getting  away from the dock.  We were motoringtowards Taleisin in  Ducky in no time  at all. Once onboard Taleisin  we got herprepped for  sailing, we looked  at each  other. We each  took a deep  breath. Ihoisted the main sail. We cast off the mooring line. Taleisin fell off the wind.The main sail filled and we were sailing!Once we  built up a little  way Annie hoisted the  stays’l, I sheeted it  in andTaleisin was moving well.  We only set the stays’l since we  just wanted to sailat  a snails  pace and  enjoy  the water.  We were  not  going fast  but it  wasglorious!Since we were moving  slowly and just kicking back Annie went  down below to gether fishing rod.  She sat on the  cabin top happily trawling  while we’re movingslowly through  the water. I  could tell by  the look on  her face that  she wasquite content. I should point out that she was fishing and directing me where togo etc…While  Annie was  trying to  catch dinner  I was  happily sailing  the boat  andtacking back  and forth on my  own. I’m sure it  was less than impressive  but Iwanted to experiment  and it was fun  and non threatening. It felt  like a greatopportunity to  do some  learning. We didn’t  spend a huge  amount of  time out,maybe an hour or two. Then is was time to head back to the mooring.When we got closer to the mooring field  we decided to drop the stays’l and sailin under  the main  only. In  theory that sounded  like it  would work,  but thecurrent was stronger than our drive under  main only. Realising the error in ourways we  had the stays’l up  again and made our  way into the mooring  field. Wedropped the stays’l again and attempted  to approach the mooring from down wind.Things didn’t work out that well. Annie said, umm that boat behind us is gettingcloser. The boat was not moving, we were going backwards.I ran forward hoisted the stays’l, yelled  “sheet it in”! Taleisin picked up wayagain and Annie was  able to steer us clear of the  few surrounding boats. Whileshe was doing this I moved quickly and maybe in a slight panic to get Ducky tiedon the quarter and get the engine running.Once the engine started  to push Taleisin I dropped the  sails. Annie said, “Theboats not turning the right way”! Due to the fact that the engine is pushing herin the other direction. I responded, “then  turn the other way”! Annie moved thetiller, Taleisin  responded and  we steered  well clear of  all other  boats. Inreality we were never  anywhere near any of these boats  they were actually wellclear of us - it just felt like  they were getting closer. We probably had a fewboat lengths between us at all times.Great, now  we have  control of  the situation! “Where’s  the mooring  buoy?”, Iasked. Annie  pointed it  out and  we slowly pushed  Taleisin towards  it. Whiledoing this is  became obvious that the wind  wants to blow the bow  off and justusing the tiller  alone was not going  to do the trick.  I started experimentingand learning again. I found that if I moved the outboard tiller all the way overI can  use it like  a stern thruster  and quickly point  the bow in  a differentdirection.We tried to get to the mooring buoy,  no luck, the current keeps pushing us off.“Approach it so the current pushes you onto the mooring”, says Annie, “Like I’vealready told you to do”. So we gave that a try, it worked, easily. I grabbed thebuoy and tied a line to it so I  could in theory relax and deal with things in acalm manner.Nice idea, I still  felt the need to haul the mooring line  over the bow roller,tied another  line through the  attachment loop and  secured it around  a winch.“Let’s get  this thing secured”,  after a  bit of effort  we managed to  get themooring attached securely. I turned to Annie and gave her a high five, “success,we did it”!I will  confess that  my adrenaline  spiked and I  was less  than cool  calm andcollected. Annie was a champ, she never missed  a beat! I needed to sit down andcollect myself. I  also had the greatest  feeling of accomplishment as  I sat onthe foredeck! Who  knew that something this simple can  feel this satisfying! Isthis what is meant by enjoying the simpler things in life?We tidied Taleisin up, Annie put some salt water on the deck. We loaded Ducky upand went  back to the dock.  Once we were tied  up I remember thinking,  “Wow, Ididn’t loose anything overboard”.  That was a bad thought. Just  as I lifted theoutboard from Ducky I noticed the trim rod  was lose and hanging out. I tried toput the motor down to get it and at the moment it fell out and I watched it sinkin the water.  This is just ridiculous!  At this rate I’ll have  nothing left tolose soon!We  went home,  content with  yet another  adventure provided  by Taleisin,  shesurely is turning out to be an adventure machine.","categories": [],

        "title": "Defeated in the Marina",
        "excerpt":"I’ve been  contemplating posting this story  for some time, clearly  this is notone of  my finest  moments. I’ve  decided to  share it  because other’s  find itpentertaining, and it might be a cautionary tale to would be engineless sailors.As is normal for me, when I get a new  toy I want to use it. At this point we’veowned Taleisin  for a few weeks.  I’ve been out on  her once with Chad  from theCYA. He  showed me how to  barge using Cheeky and  the 2.5hp motor, and  he alsotaught  me how  to scull.  Chad  is super  experienced,  I didn’t  do the  wholeprocedure myself and I don’t have any “what if” plans.I came up with a plan, if 2.5hp can do it, I can get an inflatable with a biggerengine and that should  make things much easier. So I go shopping,  I get a 2.6mZodiac and an  8hp outboard. Armed with a  new sure fire way to  get Taleisin inand out of  the marina I study the  weather forecasts and pick a  day that seemslike it would be perfect.We get  up early on Saturday  morning, I’m very excited  - like a little  kid onchristmas morning. When  I’m excited about things,  I don’t hide it  very well -everybody knows. Annie mentioned to me in the  car on the way to the marina thatshe can tell that it’s one of those excited days for me.Once we’re onboard at the marina I  start putting the inflatable together (I nowseem to  call her Ducky).  I attached  some lines to  Ducky, dropped her  in thewater and started to  tie her to the quarter. Keep in mind  this was pretty muchwinter time  in New  Zealand so  I was  wearing foul  weather gear  and thermalsunderneath them. It’s taken quite a bit longer to set everything up, which I nowknow is normal for everything boat related. Eventually we get Taleisin ready forsailing and start to go over “the plan”.So what’s the plan, Annie asks? We drop the mooring lines, I put the outboard inreverse. We back out slowly, use Taleisin’s  rudder to steer and then get out ofhere. Lets just give  it a go. That’s fine, Annie said, but  the wind has pickedup a bit…We’ll be fine, I said…We dropped the mooring  lines, I put the outboard in  reverse and Taleisin backsout slowly. All  is going great so  far. Watch out behind you,  said Annie, thatboat is getting closer. I look behind me. I put the outboard in forward. We moveforward. Move the  tiller to the other  side we need to turn.  It’s not working,says Annie. The wind was blowing the bow  off. We’re going to hit in front Annieyells. Back in reverse. We do this a  few times. While we’re doing this the windis blowing  us sideways down  the channel.  “Take the dingy  and go push  on thebow”, yells a spectator. What he didn’t know  is that I made a fatal mistake andsecured the dinghy a bit too well and there  was no way I would be able to untieit in time. This was completely and utterly stupid of me.I decided  to just  gun the outboard.  We need to  pick up  way so we  can turn.That’s what the  problem is. We’re still  not turning. Back in  reverse, gun it!Whoops that  boat behind  me is  getting close. I  hit a  piling with  the sternanchor - I’ve bent  it slightly but it will survive. At this  point I think thatit might  be a  good idea to  go forward.  By now  the bow is  in a  much betterposition  and we  might actually  get out.  I reach  for the  gear lever  on theoutboard and flick it to forward…Did I say we’ll be fine? I was wrong…Except for the fact that I didn’t close the throttle while almost at full speed.Big mistake. Rookie Mistake. The dingy still  tied to the quarter lifts it’s bowout of the water and stands up right, I  try to hang onto the seat. No luck. Theoutboard gets drowned. I end up in  the water. Taleisin is still heading for theboats in front  of her. Annie thinking  quickly and with a bit  of guidance fromthe audience we’ve now assembled on the dock, sprints up the bowsprit, grabs theforestay, both feet up against the boat in front of us. She fends like a champ!No crash  yet, that’s  good right.  While all of  this is  happening I’m  in thewater. Thinking to myself “oh crap, I have  to get back on board because this isgoing south fast”. Hanging off the side  of Taleisin I quickly drag myself up tothe bow so I can get up on the bobstay to climb back on board. Another spectatoron the dock yells, get your motor going! I hop in Ducky, try to get her started,no luck.As soon as I get  back on board I see one of our  neighbors motoring out to comeand rescue us. “Throw  me a line”, he yells! “I’ll tow you  into the channel, noworries mate”! I declined and opted to go back to the slip. “I killed the motor,no idea how I’ll get back”!Just as we’re pulling  into the slip the marina boat shows up.  I quietly say toAnnie, I’m  in a  lot of trouble  now, they wont  be happy  about this. I  had asheepish  look  on my  face  and  was very  apologetic  about  the whole  thing.Everybody just smiled and said “that’s boating, it won’t be your last…”At this point I’m feeling pretty well  defeated. I’ve been defeated in the past,but  NEVER like  this. Usually  there’s  some upside  to  the defeat  for me.  Ihonestly could not  find an upside, nothing  went well. I did a  bunch of reallydumb  things,  and I  couldn’t  even  try to  deny  it.  The results  spoke  forthemselves.The marina boat  crew and our rescue crew  just had a chuckle and  were on theirway. We did give our rescuer a pack of beers as a thank you.The outboard seemed to be fine when I got  it home and started it, I had a smallwin. I was moping around for a few  days not quite knowing how to deal with thisdefeat. My  tail was  firmly tucked  between my  legs. I  started reading  up onwarping techniques and  other engineless maneuvers. It took me  a while to buildup the courage to  take Taleisin out again. I did have  a perfect excuse though,winter was in full swing and the weather was pretty nasty. My research paid off,eventually,  we moved  Taleisin  to her  mooring  on our  own  without too  muchtrouble. I  should probably listen to  Annie more, but my  stubbornness seems toget the better of me at times.Please feel  free to  leave a comment  with your own  experiences. I  think I’verecovered from the trauma inflicted upon my  ego, you’re allowed to have a laughat my expense. Looking forward to hearing from anybody who reads this.","categories": [],

        "title": "Don't Pick at It, You'll Only Make It Worse",
        "excerpt":"Haul out day has arrived. When we  spent a day scrubbing Taleisin before we tookdelivery of her, Annie told me that we’ll have to haul her out and sand her downproperly. As  always I should just  listen to Annie,  but that would be  far tooeasy, it’s a much better idea to charge off and learn lessons the hard way…While talking to my father on the phone I mentioned that I might buy him a planeticket from Australia to come and give me a hand - I was only kidding as I wouldnever put him to  work against his will. A couple of days  later my father callsme up, asking when  Taleisin is coming out of the water as  he’s coming over andgive me a hand. Great I’ll have extra  hands to do more work. Annie’s father wasdue in  New Zealand  shortly after and  he is  always keen to  lend a  hand withanything  that  resembles  work.  There’s  a  lot  to  be  said  for  the  oldergeneration’s willingness to work, no matter  how soul destroying or miserable itmight be. So I started to make a list (oh how naive I was in my younger days).Mum and dad arrived the day before haul out. Annie was away on school camp for afew days so I was  holding down the fort - well as much  as can be expected whenpeople are foolish enough  to leave me in charge. In my  infinite wisdom I endedup booking the  haul out during the  biggest classic boat regatta  in Auckland -Taleisin should have been part of it.  Never mind, it’s booked people are comingto  help so  I’m locked  in. We’ll  be back  in the  water before  long, 2  longweekends should  be more  than enough  and with many  hands to  help it  will goquick!Haul out was  much less adventurous than  I imagined it to be.  We simply walkedTaleisin  into the  cradle  and had  a  couple  of attempts  to  get her  seatedproperly. I  probably drove the guys  in the boat  yard nuts as I  was concernedat  every  step of  the  process.  Who wouldn’t  be,  a  boat like  Taleisin  inirreplaceable. A big thank you to the crew  in the boat yard for putting up withme!Once Taleisin came out  of the water my parents thought I  was silly for wantingto haul her and paint the hull,  “There’s nothing wrong with it, it looks good”.Then  came  the mandatory  water  blasting,  again I  was  very  explicit in  myinstructions, keep  the lance far  away from the hull,  I don’t want  any damagefrom water blasting! While the water  blasting process was taking place we couldsee the anti fouling just flaking off. I’ll be the first to admit that I thoughtwe’d just be fairing in a few bits here and there and then painting over the topto get her back in the water with a nice smooth bottom quickly.We went off to the store to get some supplies to get the sanding started. That’swhen  the first  signs of  woes to  come started  to appear.  Touching the  antifouling in some places caused it to  flake off, hosing it down with tap pressureonly did the same. Other areas it was stuck.We had to hand sand as they only allowed wet sanding in the yard. It became souldestroying very quickly and  there was no visible progress at  all. When you getsomething that looks like  it might be faired in some paint  would flake off andyou start  again. Poking and  anything makes it  worse, sanding in  other placesmakes it worse. This is soul destroying work.It wasn’t  long before I realised  that we have to  go all the way  down to bareteak. This was not  the plan! This job is much much  bigger than anticipated. Somuch for the  list, now it’s just  a matter of getting this  one task completed.Taleisin might only be twenty nine and a half feet long, but she’s a HUGE boat.At  this  point  I  started  to  make  some phone  calls  to  see  how  much  itmight  cost to  get a  professional to  come  and do  the job,  most refused  totouch  wooden  boats. There  was  only  one man  for  the  job, Alan  Boyd  fromx-foul-e-8. The only problem was that Alan was busy andcouldn’t come and do  the job. Alan was kind enough to come  out to Taleisin andprovide very good advice.After  Alan  advised  us on  how  to  proceed  we  had scrapers  to  remove  theantifouling. Progress  was being made,  but it was  still really slow  going. Wescraped for 4 days, over the long weekend. Nobody in their right mind would findthis even remotely enjoyable. This is really  the dark side of boat ownership. Ibelieve it should be mandatory for any would be owner to clean the bottom of theboat he intends to buy first, if you’re still wanting the boat after that you’regood. It would  be interesting to see  how many people would still  go ahead andbuy the boat after that.After the scraping we still had to sand.  It was at this point that Annie talkedsome sense into me and I realised that it  would be cheaper for me to be at workwhile I paid someone else to finish the  job. It’s possible that one day I mightlisten to her up front…The hard  part was  telling my  dad that I’m  getting someone  else to  come andfinish the job, my dad is one of those people who refuses to pay someone to do ajob he can do himself.  I felt guilty having put him to work  for 4 days of souldestroying work only to get someone else to finish it up. Thanks Dad for all thehard work, I really do appreciate it, I still feel bad for letting you work thathard only to  end up getting someone else  to finish the job! In  my defence thework was actually far from over, it would have taken us a long time to finish itup.After a few phone calls back and forth  I finally managed to get a day that Alancould come and do the work. Suffice to say  Alan made it look like it was a walkin the park compared  to what we went through. The result  was awesome. This didmean that  Taleisin was sitting  on the hard over  the second long  weekend withnothing being  done too her. I  do believe everybody deserved  the break though,the job was horrible and the pay was even worse!The next  step was to get  painting done. Having  learnt my lesson on  the paintremoval part (also  I’ll admit reluctantly that Annie was  the sensible one, yetagain)… I enlisted  the help of professionals for this.  They promised me theywould start within a  day or 2 of Alan finishing his job.  This was important asit was  during the  hottest part  of the  year (yes  lessons have  been learnt).Taleisin was starting to dry out and she needed some paint on her bottom.Naturally,  as with  anything  that involves  a boat,  things  take longer  thanexpected. To those well  versed in the drill this will come  as no surprise, yetsomehow I’m surprised every time! The  company doing the painting couldn’t startuntil the following week. While waiting on  the painting to start I noticed thatthe seams are opening. This is not good news for a wooden boat.At this point I stopped reading online forums, every man and his dog was reporting on my progress on the forums here and here. I hit a bit of a panic and of course knowing that the internet is watching I figured I had to do something and quick.I pulled out  my phone and started with  A in my phone book.  I called everybodythat I thought might be able and willing  to help. I called Annie and told her Iwas going to bucket  salt water onto the hull to get her  wet again. By the timeAnnie arrived (50 minutes or so later) she saw this:I think this was quite an unexpected  evening for most of my friends and family,it was a great relief to have such wonderful friends and family! Most people hada lot of  fun, sure it was  hard work. It’s not  everyday you get to  be part ofsomething this  crazy though  (and when  I do  crazy, it’s  usually on  a fairlydecent scale)!The bucket brigade was a huge success, albeit a little redundant. The next day Idrove all  over Auckland talking  and meeting with  boat builders. It  turns outthat since Taleisin  has been in the water  for so long, a hose  would have donethe trick just fine as there’s plenty of  salt in the wood. The boat builder hada chuckle and said, “don’t lose any sleep over it”. Lessons learnt, but when youhit a panic you solve a problem with the tools you have at your disposal.A very special thank you to everybody that answered the call that night, it isvery much appreciated!After some panic, running around, getting advice, hiding, and other shenanigans.I finally  get around to  doing what I  should have done  in the first  place. Ibought  a lot  of shade  cloth and  hung it  around Taleisin.  This made  a hugedifference.After about  3 weeks on  the hard the painting  finally got underway.  After theprimer went on I breathed a sigh of relief! The guys painting Taleisin was greatand got  a coat of  paint on before  the 3 weekend  started, this made  me sleepquite  a  bit better.  As  with  the  guys in  the  boat  yard, these  guys  hadto  put  up with  a  lot  from  me.  A big  thank  you  to  the team  at  Glossboats.Next it was  a coat of blue anti foul.  The theory is that when we  start to seeblue on the hull  Taleisin is due for a few coats of  paint rather than just onecoat annually. Time will tell if this is a sound theory or not.Naturally this is followed by two coats in her natural colour.After the  painting was  completed there  was one more  challenge, a  huge stormrolled in. This was a pretty nasty one and a few boats ended on the rocks in themooring area where we keep Taleisin.The storm delayed  us getting back in the  water, which was fine with  me. I wasactually happier with  Taleisin on the hard  than in the water.  After the stormran it’s course I was very sad to see that the little boat above was Patricia, acarvel plank  H28. She went  back in the  water just as  we came out.  Her ownerspent a very long time fixing her up to get back in the water. I remember havingsome banter  with him regarding engines.  He had to haul  Patricia again becausethere was a leak around the prop shaft - I was a little smug about the fact thatTaleisin doesn’t have those kinds of issues.  I was heart broken when I saw thisthough:After what can only be described as a nightmare of 4 weeks long, we were finallygetting the old girl back in the water.Getting  Taleisin  back on  the  mooring  was  rather  uneventful or  free  fromadventure if you wish…A few days after I had finally got the  nerve to give Lin a call, I told her thestory. Lin had a chuckle and said: “Taleisin is a tough old boat”, what I shouldhave done was given Lin a call from the start and save myself a lot of worrying.It’s how ever  very easy to be  reasonable after the fact, hind  sight is always20/20.It’s taken me quite a while to write  about this ordeal, it’s not always easy toface up to your short comings and admit that things weren’t always perfect. Thisstory  did have  a happy  ending, but  I can  assure you  that it  was a  fairlystressful time for me. I have to admit  that the internet was rather kind to me,it could have been so much worse!Thank you to  everybody who stopped by  an offered support and thank  you to allthose  who got  roped into  helping  with something  at some  point during  thisadventure.","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"When we first  bought Taleisin we considered getting an  outboard mounted on thetransom. We even got  a boat builder out in the first couple  of weeks of havingher in  the marina. If  you’re familiar with Taleisin  you’ll know that  she wasbuilt and designed to hate motors. Nothing  is easy with Taleisin, simple is noteasy. Luckily I love a good challenge!After many talks with a lot of different people I finally came to the conclusionthat I’m not likely to get a motor mounted on Taleisin. If you’ve been followingthis blog you’ll be aware of my defeat  in the marina with Ducky on the quarter.Not  my finest  moment, but  I’m  sure it  was  entertaining to  many. I’ve  hadsuggestions of  putting a  well in the  lazaret (with a  plywood box),  I’ve hadsuggestions  of sacrificing  the sits  tub for  an inboard  engine. I’ve  alwayslistened and considered things,  but honestly when people tell me  to put a holein Taleisin they normally  lose me. The day will come when I  finally put a holein her somewhere, but not yet.I’ve spent many  hours researching motors, electric and  conventional. I’ve madenew friends on  the internet while doing  this. I looked at  inboard options andoutboard options. I  looked at electric pod motors, electric  trolling motors. Idid thought experiments with these different types of motors. I calculated costsvs benefits. Weight, practicality and anything  else I could think of. I thoughtabout different ways to mount the motor, using existing chainplates and rigging,mounting it on  the rudder, hanging it  from the bumpkin on  a cantilever. Wherewould holes  need to be  made in order  to make it  viable. I considered  a sidemounted motor, but rejected that idea because when I had Ducky on the quarter itwas very hard to get steerage as low speed.Always at some  point I’d stop and  ask myself, what’s the objective?  What am Itrying to  achieve with all of  this. The answer  is never, to give  Taleisin anengine. The  answer is always to  facilitate learning and accelerate  our way upthe learning  cliff (that’s when the  curve goes up and  backwards). Taleisin isnot a beginners  boat, that means we  can’t take the usual  approach to learningwith her.When  I got  completely and  utterly defeated  by Taleisin  in the  marina Anniesuggested that we get a mooring and try that approach first (I actually listenedthat  time). It  worked and  we learnt  quite a  bit while  on the  mooring. Thereality though, we didn’t get out on Taleisin as much as we should have. Gettingto and from  the mooring was a  long and slow process. Keeping  the objective inmind, this  was the  opposite. I’d be  lying if  I said that  I didn’t  drive byTaleisin every time the weather was acting up, to check on her. I probably wouldnot be  able to do much  in the event that  something went wrong, but  I checkednone the less. Every storm I’d be  laying awake at night worrying about Taleisinon the mooring (for the record, worrying does nothing but make you feel bad).With the seasons  changing, I said to  Annie we’re going back in  the marina forwinter. This  wasn’t a hard sell  as Annie must  have been concerned too.  So wewaited for a nice day to move Taleisin back into the marina. This of course leftus stuck in the marina again. I started on solving the motor challenge again. Ifit’s easy  to come and go  from the marina, we’ll  use Taleisin a lot  more, andwe’ll learn faster!About the  same time Lin sent  me an email  saying that there’s some  people shethinks we’d enjoy meeting, they live on their wooden boat around the corner fromTaleisin. I called Doug and went to his  boat Karie L. We hit it off immediatelyand it  wasn’t long before I  started talking about  my idea for a  motor mount.Doug was kind enough to help me with it.Doug produced a  lot of conceptual drawings which eventually  lead to the designthat’s now mounted on Taleisin’s bumpkin.Doug made a pattern for the design and  we got it cast in bronze, I’m very happywith the results!The essence  of the mount  is a  length of teak  across the bumpkin,  behind therudder. This  is clamped onto  the bumpkin with 2  wooden blocks made  from teakwith bronze bolts through it on either side of the spruce timber of the bumpkin.We’ve put  some rubber  padding between  the timbers to  protect it.  The bronzecasting slides over the timbers on the port side (in theory this is a reversiblebracket). Timber pads are glued on with sikaflex on the mounting plate, a coupleof rivets are also in place as a “just in case”.We bought a 20HP Honda outboard. The motor has a 20” shaft, the dealer was greatand installed  a 5” spacer to  make this a 25”  shaft motor, none of  this workswithout a 25” shaft motor!With a  bit of fun  and games we  eventually managed to  get the motor  onto thebracket. The Leopard Seal in the marina came to investigate while we were at it,it was likely the banging noise from riveting.We started the motor up and had it  running in forward and reverse. I had alwaysknown that there would be flex in  the mount if it’s not braced. Doug’s originalconcept had a tie-rod  from the chain plate to the mounting  plate. It was clearthat this would be required.At this point  rather than jumping in  and getting a tie-rod in  place I thoughtI’d take  a step back and  play around with a  few different ideas first.  In myoriginal  idea there  was a  brace that  pushed up  against the  transom and  itlashings to the  chain plate and taffrail.  While thinking about all  of this itdawned on  me that  I didn’t  take shock loading  into consideration.  The motorweighs 52kg.  Shock loading could  turn that  into 500kg static  load equivalentwithout too  much effort (think gravity  when bouncing up and  down over waves).Taking a wave against  the motor is another thing all together  - I haven’t evenstarted to think  about mitigating that scenario, other than  don’t get into thesituation in the first place.So my  thinking cap  went on again.  I decided  to get some  cheap timber  for aprototype from the off-cuts bin at the local hardware store. I knocked somethingup that’s  functional. I bolted it  on with 2 eye  bolts. I got some  Dyneema tocreate rigging of some  sorts to keep the brace up against  the transom while inforward and reverse. I added a couple  of turn buckles so I could tighten thingsup. I  used a sewn webbing  sling with a larks  foot on the taffrail.  I added ashackle between the sling and the Dyneema to avoid friction melting through both(it’s very  scary how  easy this  is to do,  it’s something  I learnt  from rockclimbing). The shackle is tri-loaded which is not ideal, but I doubt it would bethe first point  of failure. One lashing is  around the brace to lift  it up andwedge it in place  against the transom. The other is to  the eyebolt which takessome of the motor load. This configuration gives me the triangle structure I wasafter to create a strong support.This rig serves 2  purposes. The first is that it stops  the mount flexing underthe motor’s torque.  The second is that  it transfers some of the  load from thebumpkin to the taffrail for shock loading.With all  of this  in place,  Paul, another  friend I  made because  of Taleisinwalked by on  Friday afternoon just as  I was finishing everything up.  He had aquick look and thought it looked good. The  next thing he asked if I was keen togive it a go.So we  prepped Taleisin for her  maiden voyage under  her own motor. We  came upwith a plan  and started to back  out. The sub-title of this  blog is “AdventureMachine”, and this post would not be complete without some adventure…We let the  mooring lines go and  start backing Taleisin out. Paul  asked if thebowsprit was clear from  the pilings as we’re about to turn  into the fairway. Isaid the bowsprit  was clear. Paul asked if  we were good to go,  and suddenly Inoticed that  the floating  line between  the bow and  stern mooring  lines werecaught on the lifelines. I ran to release it. It wasn’t possible as I had undonethe lifelines to get the motor on board and had tangled the floating line in theprocess. This meant that we’re still attached to the dock.Quick, put her in forward, I yelled. We got Taleisin stopped so I could undo thelifelines. Paul was up at the bow fending so that the wind wouldn’t blow us intothe launch next  to us. I got  the lifelines undone and released  us without toomuch trouble. Disaster averted!Back to getting Taleisin out. We backed out and were able to use the outboard asa bit  of a  stern thruster by  turning it  with it’s tiller.  At this  point itstarted to feel like cheating. It was actually easy moving Taleisin. We left thefairway without any issue. The motor was  not pushing Taleisin’s bow off like weexperienced with ducky on the quarter. It was actually easy to move her!We took Taleisin  out into the harbour  with her new motor, pushing  against a 2knot current we were  making 4 knots over the ground.  Everything seemed to workas  expected. It’s  worth noting  that Paul  had a  blast, we  both enjoyed  theexperience! Paul mentioned that we were busy making history.Coming  back into  the  berth was  not terribly  difficult  either, compared  toprevious experiences!It’s a little premature  to call it a complete success. I still  need to see howthings behave  when under sail.  The interesting thing  I noticed is  that whilepushing along under  motor the bit of  timber used to brace  against the transomactually  gets submerged  at times.  If the  motor did  not have  a 25”  shaft Isuspect it  would be  in danger  of drowning.  While I  don’t expect  any issuesthere’s a chance that things might get interesting on a starboard tack. The onlyway to find this out is to give it  a try. Given that the stern doesn’t go underwater when sailing  normally there’s no real  reason to believe the  motor is indanger.We’ll be  running with the motor  as is for the  time being so I  can figure outwhat the next best  step would be. I’m currently thinking  that a tie-rod systemof some sort  would be a good  way to go. It’s  been pointed out to  me that thetaffrail might not be  as strong as it looks. For this I  might figure out a wayto get a block underneath it between the deck and the taffrail to strengthen it.The other option I  am thinking about with regard to  strenthening the whole lotis to replace the wire rigging underneath the bumpkin with a couple of tie-rods.I wont  be making any decisions  in a hurry and  will test the system  in gentleconditions first.The next problem I’ll  be trying to solve, is a method for  lifting the motor onboard so  I can store  is down below  in the lazaret. If  I can devise  a simplesystem for this it  would become possible to bring the motor  up on deck withoutmuch drama  and most  of these  concerns might  go away.  Provided of  course itbecomes easy to do under way - which is probably far from trivial.What I like about this approach is that  I’ve not altered Taleisin, so if I wantto change anything I  can without consequences. I can fine  tune and evolve thisinto more if I want  to or we can use it to learn  enough to become confident inmoving Taleisin the way she was intended  to be moved. We have more options withthis solution than  the alternatives, it’s not possible to  “unmake” holes. It’sfar from a perfect  solution, but it’s very pragmatic. It  looks like it belongson the boat too, which is a nice bonus.A big  thank you  to everybody  who has  had any  discussions with  me regardingmotors and mounting them. It all added up and this is the sum total of all thoseconversations, even  if you  suggested putting  a hole  in the  boat it  was allvaluable. We certainly would not have gotten  this far without all the input andideas from everybody.If anybody reading this  sees a major flaw in my thinking,  please point it out!If  you have  any  clever idea,  I’d  love to  hear  them! If  and  when I  makesignificant changes I’ll do a follow up blog post if there’s any interest in it.","categories": [],

        "title": "Why a 20 hp Outboard",
        "excerpt":"After some discussions on forums, it became obvious that I’d have to do a followup post on why I got a 20 hp. Honda motor.There was a few variables that went into the equation.Weight, Cost and Horsepower.I looked at  the Torqeedo 4 kw motor. That  in theory was a good idea,  8 hp. incruise  mode, 10  hp. thrust  (which incidentally  Lin and  Larry said  would beenough).  This motor  is about  20 kg.  Then comes  the batteries.  The Torqeedobatteries are 24.3 kg. each, you  require 2. These batteries are very expensive,so going with a lead-acid/AGM option you’d  need 4 x 200 A/H batteries (Torqeedobatteries  are 24V  lithium).  Finding  space for  these  batteries  would be  achallenge in it’s  own right. Not to  mention that the costs would  be very highfor a  setup like  this and  charging would be  a challenge  unless you’re  in amarina. Even then  it’s very easy to add  petrol to a tank, start  the motor andgo. Not  the same with batteries.  This is also  not a simple setup,  it’s quitecomplicated and at odds with the rest  of the boat. Incidentally I looked at the10 kw motor too, that weighs 64kg and requires twice as many batteries, so twicethe problem.  Not to  mention 3  times the cost  without installation  costs andbrackets etc.So the other option is to go  for petrol. I wanted something that’s simple, thatmeans manual tilt, tiller steer and pull start.The Yamaha  9.9 hp. has been  mentioned, I rejected  that motor due to  the factthat it’s  electric start  only (battery and  more complication  required), thismotor also  weights 49 -  52KG depending on  the model. So  not a lot  of upsidehere.Tohatsu is another one that was mentioned. The dealers proved challenging to geta quote from,  at first. This lead me  to wonder what support would  be like, ifthey are in sales  mode they are at their best, so they  won’t get any better…The motor  that was quoted was  not only 20%  more expensive than the  Honda butalso weighed 62 kg. It’s worth noting  that this was a manual/electric start andalso a manual/power tilt - which explains the weight.Honda, I looked at  the 8/10 hp which is the same  motor just tuned differently,this was 48 kg. The 15/20 hp. which  is the same motor just tuned differently at52 kg.These are the only motors I’ll mention as inboards were not an option due to therequired hole(s) in the hull. Other manufacturers didn’t do 25” shafts.At the end  of the day the weight  vs benefit ration landed me with  Honda 20 hp25” shaft, of course the dealer was fantastic too so that helps.A quick  note on electric  inboards. The cost of  the motor and  batteries wouldhave been 3  times the total of  the outboard solution. I didn’t  even bother tocost the installation  of it. It was  considered as a hypothetical  case, but itwas never really  an option. This of  course comes with the problem  of where tostore all those batteries. The same goes for electric POD motors.Taking all of the  above and possibly a lot of things I  forgot about, it seemedthat the sensible choice would be to go for 20 hp. over 8 hp. for a 4 kg. weightincrease. The option to  go with a smaller engine is always  there too, not thatyou gain much by going smaller, maybe if I  went for a 5 hp. motor it might havemade a noticeable difference in weight. Taleisin is 8 tons when empty, the 8 hp.on the rubber  ducky does the job but  leaves a lot to be  desired and certainlywont stop her in a  hurry if it’s needed. I learnt that the  hard way when I gotdefeated in the marina (see the post about it).","categories": [],

        "title": "Port Townsend Wooden Boat Festival 2016",
        "excerpt":"Our  recent status  as  wooden boat  owners  has  opened up  many  new doors  tointerested and exciting  opportunities. We are not only new  to wooden boats butto boats and sailing itself. One evening after completing one of many boat tasksI gave  Lin Pardey a call  to share my  experiences. Lin suggested that  we comealong to the  wooden boat festival in Port Townsend  Washington State, USA. Thispresented numerous challenges concerning work for  both Annie and myself. When Igot home that evening I told Annie about this random spur of the moment idea andwe decided that life is too short, screw it - lets do it!I distinctly remember Annie asking, “What will I be doing for three whole days”?Fast forward to September 6 2016, we’re on our way to Port Townsend via Seattle.This is one of  the routes into Port Townsend. In order to  get to Port Townsendyou  really want  to have  to get  there. Driving  from Seattle  takes 2  hours,getting there by  public transport is quite  a feat in itself.  Our journey fromSeattle started early  in the morning taking  the train from our  hotel close tothe SeaTac  airport. A short walk  from down town  Seattle to a 30  minute ferryride. Once off the  Ferry we caught a bus to Poulsbo, then  we spent the bulk ofthe day in Poulsbo  waiting for one of 2 buses to Port  Townsend, one at 9am andone at 5pm. We  didn’t do our homework properly and weren’t  quite aware of thisfact…Eventually we made our  way into Port Townsend late in  the afternoon. We walkedfrom the bus stop to our accommodation. Everybody in town was very friendly, thehomeless people  sleeping in the  park were greeting us  as we walked  past. Thefeel of the town was worlds apart from the busy city. Port Townsend truly is thehidden gem of the pacific north west.  Our hosts drove us into town that eveningfor dinner. It’s worth noting that we have never met them before. They were kindenough  to put  us  up for  the  duration of  the festival  at  no charge.  It’simportant  to note  that  if  you’re planning  on  attending  the festival  thataccommodation books out a year in advance,  plan well ahead and book very early.After dinner I had to  use a bit of slight of hand so  that I could actually paythe bill, our hosts were being too kind to us. This was only the start of a verywarm reception in this wonderful town.The next morning  our hosts sent me a  text message to inform me  that they haveleft us passes  for the festival which will  get us in, free of  charge. This isgenerally not  the sort of thing  we’re used to.  We stayed close enough  to thefestival grounds  so that we  could walk.  We set off  early in the  morning andthere was a  bit of a chill in the  air. By the time we reached  the festival itwas nice and warm.The festival is held in the marina on the edge of town. There are over 300 boatspacked  in like  sardines. The  harbour master  did a  fantastic job.  The boatsranged from large steamers and schooners  to small row boats, beautiful stand uppaddle boards  and kayaks. If  there was a  way to build it  out of wood  and itfloated you could find it there. This might sound strange but there were so manybeautiful boats  that it all got  lost in the  abundance. It was really  hard toappreciate each  individual boat with so  many around it. The  docks were filledwith enthusiasts  of all  ages. It didn’t  take long before  we were  invited toboard vessels,  with proud owners showing  off their baby. We  could spend hourstalking to one owner  and looking at just one boat. Unfortunately  we only had 3days to see as many of the 300 odd boats as we could.With so  many boats around,  and so many  Kiwi’s, there was  bound to be  a Kiwiboat. Heather  is a 37 footer  built in Auckland  in 1937. She completed  a solocircumnavigation in  the mid  60’s and  sailed to  Hawaii in  the 70’s,  now sheresides in Port Townsend. It was great to see a little bit of home.Given  the amount  of boats  it became  quite  clear that  3 days  would not  beenough, to  add to the  challenge there  were multiple seminars  being presentedsimultaneously throughout the entire festival. It was impossible to choose whichseminars to attend and which to skip. They were all very well presented and fullof incredibly useful information. If you were  that way inclined you could get 3days worth of value out of just  attending seminars. While all of this is takingplace there’s a bunch of teams building wooden boats for the competition that isheld over  the three days. We  were so busy that  we never got to  see the finalresults. We  managed to have one  walk by to  inspect the progress on  the firstday. We spent some time in the  seminars, all the seminars we attended were wellpresented and has something of value in them.Our hosts put on a fantastic BBQ for  some of us Kiwis, we spent the whole nighthaving a great  time with all the new  friends we made. While at the  BBQ it wassuggested that we try to get onboard  for the schooner racing. We spent the nextmorning trying to find  a boat to crew on. We were  not successful, barefoot Bobto the rescue! We met Bob at the BBQ our hosts put on for the Kiwis, he’s a verycolourful character with  a great sense of  humour. Bob found us  a spot onboardSassafrass, the  owners were very friendly  and we had a  blast. There’s nothingquite like experiencing these wonderful boats  out on the water under full sail!This took up the entire afternoon, while  it cost us valuable time we could haveused looking at boats at the docks. This experience was well worth the cost!If that was not enough, the town  is littered with antique shops and second handbookshops. This  is another favourite of  ours, we only managed  2 bookshops andone antique shop, it was huge, the biggest antique shop we’ve ever been in. Thisalone made us wish we had 3 weeks to spend in this wonderful town.To top the experience off there were all  kinds of toys and eye candy for boats.Almost anything  imaginable for wooden boats.  The foundry had a  display of thewonderful goodies  they can  make for  your boat.  Authors selling  their books,tools,  tools and  more  tools. If  you’re  a  lover of  wooden  boats, this  iscertainly the place to  be. I recommend you come for the  festival, but stay forthe town and it’s wonderful people!The festival  closes with the  most spectacular event.  All the boats  leave themarina and  sail up and  down the  harbour so that  everybody can see  them fromshore. I have never  in my life seen so many beautiful wooden  boats sail at thesame time. There were  classics as far as the eye could see.  To quote a friend,“You can’t beat the classics!”I mentioned earlier that there’s only 2  buses in and out of Port Townsend. Thisleft us  with a  bit of  a dilemma.  Since I  didn’t do  my homework  and bookedflights out of SeaTac  for 9am on Monday, this meant we would  have to leave thefestival at 4pm on Sunday to catch the  bus at 5pm back to Seattle and spend thenight at the airport. When I started  to ask around if there was anybody leavingsuper early on Monday  morning so we could catch the 6am  ferry (2 hours drive),barefoot Bob came to our rescue. Bob is  a Port Townsend local, he’s got a heartof gold. He  asked around, since he  was working with the harbour  master he wastalking to lots of  people. He came up empty handed, but  in the most unexpectedbit  of kindness  he offered  to drive  us  to the  ferry at  4am himself.  Thisillustrates just how  kind the people in  this little town are. Bob  made an offthe cuff  comment that this  is what  they do in  Port Townsend. I  believe him,everybody was awesome!Suffice to  say we made the  journey on Monday  morning and caught our  plane toBoston without any drama. A special  thanks to barefoot Bob, Brion and Christianfor making our  stay in Port Townsend very special  and something we’ll rememberfor the rest of our lives.If you ever  find yourself in Port  Townsend, find barefoot Bob!  Buy him lunch,dinner or a beer. This will give you an excuse to meet him, he is awesome!PS. If you’re looking for more pictures check out my collection over here","categories": [],

Well maybe, we’re not heading  off shore, but we have cast the docklines off  for the  time being.  We’ve got  the boat  provisioned and  we’re outplaying!This will be a little longer than  the previous weekend cruise we did (I haven’twritten about it yet, but it was  great). We’re currently sitting at anchor in asmall bay called Okoromai (Shakespeare) Bay.  We’re the only boat anchored here,and there might be a reason for that we’re not sure yet.Our  plan  was to  sail  to  Kawau  Island today,  but  there  was no  wind,  sounfortunately we had to use the noisy  outboard motor to get away from the dock.The bottom line is that we’re out, away from the dock and we’re sailing! Well wewill be! We’ve decided to hang out in this little bay until the wind picks up sowe can continue our little journey to Kawau Island.There’s not much to  say about the adventure today as  it was rather uneventful.We managed  to leave the marina  just fine, which of  course is a huge  bonus aswe’ve not had the best of luck with marina adventures to date! We managed to geta  bit of  sailing done  in  the harbour  but  then the  winds died  completely.Motoring is not fun  and we didn’t really care for it. It  was really a means toan end,  now that we’ve left  the doc we don’t  feel the pressure of  needing toleave. That part is done!Given that we’ve been  so busy with the run up to Christmas  we’re both tired sonow  it’s time  to rest  and recover  from all  the stress  we’ve placed  on ourbodies.Below are  some pictures  of the  little anchorage we’re  in. We’re  anchored inabout 4.5 meters of water and so far it would seem like a calm quite anchorage!","categories": [],

        "title": "Return to North Cove",
        "excerpt":"Our original  plan was  to sail to  North Cove yesterday.  But the  winds didn’tco-operate, instead we motored all day and tucked in for the night.So, it turns out  that it was quite a bouncy anchorage,  easily corrected with asnubber off  the bowsprit. Whilst  this didn’t stop the  bounce it made  it morethan habitable.This morning I said to Annie, “I want to sail off the anchor!”. We had the motorin neutral, just in  case. I  prepared Taleisin for  sailing while  Annie cookedbreakfast. After we finished eating and  putting Taleisin in order down below wewinched in the anchor until we were just  about ready to lift it. We hoisted thestays’l. Annie grabbed the tiller and when  the anchor was up she sheeted in thestays’l. We were off without a hitch! I hoisted the main and the jib while Annieslowly sailed us out of the anchorage. It was a nice start to the day.The winds  were much better  today. We managed  to sail reasonably  smoothly allday. Slight bit  of chop out in  the open water but nothing  like we experiencedwhen we sailed Taleisin to Westhaven the very firs time.As we  approached North Cove a  little speed boat  zoomed right in front  of ourbow, I was  wondering why they were zooming  by so close and then  I realised itwas Lin in  Jay Dee. Lin took some  photos of us as we sailed  Taleisin into thecove.We motored around looking  for a spot to anchor. I picked a  spot that I thoughtlook good. We dropped the anchor. Then Annie said, I think we’re dragging! Ok noproblem, we’ll try again. Winch the anchor in and motor around for a second try.We try it  again and same problem again!  Ok so this time we  weighed the anchorand went further out than I would have  liked. We found a spot of clear water sowe can have lots of room. I drop the anchor. This time I’m not messing around weput 35 fathoms of chain out! Now we’re holding.Lin did  come by and offer  us a mooring  that’s available. I suggested  that wemove but  Annie thought that 3  attempts at anchoring was  enough excitement forone day. Fair enough I figured! We can try to pick up the mooring in the morningwhen we have time for more adventure.Annie cooked us a lovely dinner and we’re just settling in for the night.Here’s some photos of North Cove, Taleisin hasn’t been home in some time…","categories": [],

        "title": "Hanging Out in North Cove",
        "excerpt":"We turned in  early last night, we  were both absolutely exhausted.  As an addedbonus we slept in this morning too. It’s  not like we have somewhere to be!? Theplan was to move Taleisin to a mooring closer to Lin’s place.After we  finally decided to  wake up we  went on deck  and the cove  was nearlyempty. We were trying  to figure out which mooring we were  supposed to pick up.After a bit of back and forth Annie suggested that we row over and check it out,even tough it would be a right pain to row back.While we were busy trying to get Cheeky off the cabin top a friendly sailor camealong side in a kayak and introduced herself.  We invited her on board for a bitof a chat as it was quite choppy in  the spot we anchored. It turns out that herboat was on the mooring next to the one  we were moving to. We asked her if she’dmind helping us move. She was a real sport and jumped to it.I felt bad putting her on the windlass as she wasn’t comfortable on the helm andour cat does not like strangers so we  couldn’t give her the easy job of flakingthe chain into the  chain locker. I winched in most of the  chain as it’s reallyhard work and  left the last bit to  her. Later she mentioned that  she was realproud of herself  for using the manual windlass but  that she really appreciatesthe electric windlass on her boat.It was fairly uneventful apart from the fact that I still need to learn that thewind affects the boats direction, so heading in the direction I want to go in isnot likely to be  the direction we’re actually going. The two  girls did a greatjob fending off a power boat that I would have hit otherwise.We did a couple of takes to get  close to the right mooring (which turned out tobe the wrong  mooring in the end).  Annie grabbed the mooring buoy  like a champand we were tied on in no time at all.Once on the  mooring we decided that it’s  probably time to have a  shower so wegave the shower facilities on board a try.  After all this is the reason we haveno inboard engine. While it will take a little bit getting used to the shower itwas still much  better than trying to  shower while camping. I  think we’ll keepthe bath tub instead of putting an engine in there!After we  were nice  and clean  Annie decided that  she wanted  to tidy  and putthings in  a bit more  order. I chose  to go up on  deck to replace  some lines.After all I’m  lugging 3 bails of line  with us to do just that.  I replaced theold preventer vang that was getting on  in the years a bit. Annie suggested thatI upcycle  a bit  of old cruddy  rope to  weave a mat  for our cat  to use  as ascratchy pad.  I broke out  the Ashley books of  knots and found  something thatlooked suitable. Here’s the result:After finishing what  we set out to do  on board we rowed ashore to  have a nicevisit with Lin.","categories": [],

It  tasted asgood as it looks.After  a bit  of trial  and error  we figured  out how  to use  the oven  aboardTaleisin. We did of  course have the benefit of being on a  mooring just a shortrow from Lin’s door step. Lin is  always very helpful and knows everything aboutanything aboard Taleisin.We’ve been  having a great time  in North Cove.  Lin invited us over  for dinneralong with the family on the French yacht next to us. Lin served what could onlybe described as the best salmon I’ve  ever had. Everything is always lovely whenyou’re over  for dinner at  the Pardey’s.  The company is  good and the  food isalways excellent!We’ve had plenty of people come along  side Taleisin for a closer look. They arealways very friendly  and pleasant to have  a chat to. We’ve  been invited twicealready to  go visit some  friends along  one of the  beaches. We feel  a littleguilty as  we’ve been so lazy  that we haven’t made  it there yet. To  be honestwe’re probably just so exhausted from the rat race that we’re in need of all thesleep we’ve been catching up on.Earlier today we decided to move to the correct mooring. Annie suggested that wewarp onto  the mooring as  it’s close by  and it would  be easier to  put backupplans in place, than to start up the  outboard. The added bonus is that it wouldbe quiet and, not disturb any of the boats around us.Annie decided  that she would row  the warp out. We  attached a warp to  the oldmooring and to the stren, the warp Annie rowed out was attached to the bow. Thisconfiguration allowed us to prevent Taleisin  from swinging into other boats, wecould control her speed by breaking with the  stern line on a winch, and most ofall we never  lost control of her.  We worked together to  keep Taleisin runningnicely along  the two  lines and  gently glided  her into  place on  the correctmooring. It was fun and we’ve had lots  of practice at it already so we probablydidn’t look too  terrible doing it. We’ve  even had some kind  comments about itfrom the other sailors.Among the  other small jobs I’ve  been doing on  Taleisin I replaced the  last 2halyards, she’s  looking quite fresh  with the  majority of the  lines replaced.Doing one or two a day really adds up quickly. Replacing the lifelines will takequite a bit of effort as it involves the jib net and sewing leather anti-chafingonto the lines where they go through the stanchions.All in  good time, it doesn’t  feel like work as  it’s quite enjoyable to  do. Ithink the key is  to slowly chip away at these jobs  and everything just becomesmanageable. Maintenance  is a  lot less of  a chore when  you’re already  on theboat, it  seems to just  happen as  a matter of  course. When you  see somethingsmall that needs doing, you just do it.So far cruising  seems to be great!  We’re loving it and  most importantly we’restill talking to each other!","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"Looking at the  date, 2016 is finally over.  I believe a lot of  people would behappy to see the back of 2016. Happy New Year, may 2017 be a good one.Last year when we were at the wooden  boat festival we did an interview with DanMattson.  It was  a bit  of fun  and  Dan has  just sent  me the  word that  theinterview is up on his pod cast. If you’re curious have a listenhereWe’re still hanging out  in North Cove, we got invited to a  small new years evegathering with  the locals. We had  a great time and  got to see parts  of NorthCove we’ve never seen before. This place  is magical. When we head over that wayagain I’ll  be sure to take  some pictures.

        "title": "Baking Bread",
        "excerpt":"Today I baked  a loaf of bread. Very  exciting, I know. It’s been  almost a weeksince we consumed our  last bread and I’ve been promising Annie  that I’d bake aloaf of bread. It’s something I used to do a few years ago so the concept is notnew to me. How ever I’ve never done it all by hand without electricity. It’s notrocket science to bake bread. Yeast, a bit  of sugar, water and flour with a bitof salt will be the job done. Use a bit of elbow grease and it’s not long beforeyou have something that resembles dough.The hardest part was figuring out how to get the oven on board Taleisin to do mybidding. The actual baking  part took a bit longer, but I suspect  with a bit oftrial and error I’ll get the hang of it. The loaf actually came out pretty good.We’ve just about eaten  half of it already. Having said all of  that, it took methe better part of the day to do it. It’s the time waiting in between that takeslong, the work is minimal.So far our stay in North Cove is  wonderful, the locals are friendly and we keepgetting invited to hang out with them. I’m starting to feel a bit guilty becauseI’m being so  lazy and not really doing  much. Our aim is to get  out sailing inthe next few days and maybe go practice anchoring in the next bay over.Another thing to mention is that rowing Cheeky2 is getting easier. Wedeliberately left the outboard at home to force us to row and get better at it.I’m sure over time this will not be an issue at all and we’ll be healthier forit. One thing we have been doing is taking turns rowing. If I row out Annie willrow back. That way we both get practice and exercise.","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"Back on the tidal  grid! Since Taleisin is home and she still  fits on the tidalgrid at Lin’s we decided that it would be a good idea to give the bottom a cleanand inspect the seacock that’s been giving me grief as of late.We got  the motor  going and  took Taleisin for  a trip  around the  bay, mostlybecause the wind was blowing and we weren’t comfortable taking the direct route.We navigated our way through all the moored boats and slowly made our way to thejetty.I  followed Larry’s  advice: “Don’t  go any  faster than  you’re willing  to hitsomething”. We came  into the dock very  slow and Annie climbed  off and grabbedthe stern line. I  had already placed the motor in neutral and  got ready to hopoff to  grab the bow line.  Then we heard  a loud crack. Whoops,  something musthave gone wrong!One of the fenders got caught on one  of the cross braces and it snapped the endoff where  the nail went  through. As  a consequence I’ve  now got to  fix Lin’sjetty. It  was a case of  just putting enough  pressure on just the  right spot.Luckily Lin wasn’t upset with us so once we fix it, it will be all good again.We  walked Taleisin  onto the  grid and  Lin came  to double  check that  we goteverything just right. Then it was time to wait for the tide to go out.We were  invited to a BBQ  at 5pm and  low tide was  at 5pm. So not  wasting anytime, I just got to the task as soon as I could wade into the water and give hera good scrub down. It was a lot easier  this time. There was no tears and we gotthe job done before 5pm.I  also took  the seacock  apart. I  gave  it a  clean and  discovered that  theinternal bronze  tube has  corroded away.  This is not  critical to  keeping thesystem sealed up, but I will attempt to manufacture a replacement for it.The hospitality in North Cove is still  great, we had another great evening withthe locals. Today we’re heading to the  main land with Lin, hopefully we can getrid of some of our trash and re-supply some fresh food.","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"We’re back floating! The last couple of days have been fairly laid back, sure wedid  some work  on Taleisin.  Double  checking the  hull is  clean, making  sureeverything is removed behind the rudder. She’s looking pretty sweet! While I wasat it,  I got Lin  to supervise me  replacing the Sikaflex  on a few  small deckseams. Whilst  it’s not rocket  science, there was a  few things I  didn’t know.It’s always silly  in my eyes to not  learn from those around you  before you goexperimenting and  trying to work  out how to  do something that’s  already beendone.This morning  we decided  to sail around  to the Kawau  boating club,  seeing aswe’re  newly joined  members we  get some  benefits from  membership, like  freeshowers, laundry and water. We needed all three of those.We attempted to  sail off the mooring  in North Cove, but the  temptation of themotor  was too  great. The  wind was  light  and it  seemed like  we were  goingbackwards. We only had a short sail around the corner though…We used  the outboard  to get out  of North  Cove and caught  some wind.  It wasreally annoying  me that  we used  the motor  and it  felt like  we gave  up tooeasily. So  we sailed under  full canvas around the  corner and into  Bon AccordHarbour. Since I  still had the sour taste  in my mouth from using  the motor, Iwas determined to get a win today even if it’s just a small one.I said to  Annie, we’re going to sail  past the boat club under  full sail, turnaround and  come back to  anchor. For bonus points  since it’s not  blowing thathard, lets try to do it under sail.So we  had our plan, we  were reaching into the  harbour and then the  wind dieddown.  We were  doing 0.7  knots according  to  the GPS.  It felt  like we  werestanding  still. We  could see  the club  house, but  it looked  like it  was aneternity away. Since we weren’t in any danger and there was nothing around us wepersisted.  We were  waiting  for the  wind  to pick  up. It  was  a little  bitfrustrating and very tempting  to use the motor, but we refused  to give up. Thewind  finally picked  up and  we  were doing  4.8  knots according  to the  GPS.Persistence paid off!As we  sailed past the  club house we  picked a spot  to anchor, well  away fromother boats! I dropped the jib while Annie sailed us through the other boats. Wegybed and came back around under main  and stays’l. As we approached the spot wewanted to anchor  in I dropped the main  while Annie kept us going  in the rightgeneral direction. I let the anchor go while still sailing slowly under stays’l.When we had a reasonable amount of chain  out and it looked like the anchor haveset I  dropped the stays’l and  let out some  more chain. Taleisin fell  off andstarted to lay head to  the wind. We sat on deck for about  an hour to make sureeverything was ok.Both Annie and myself felt pretty good  about anchoring under sail. We were alsothe only  ones who sailed  into the harbour at  that particular time,  let aloneanchor under sail. I will chalk this one up to a successful adventure!We spent the rest of the day  doing laundry and carrying water to Taleisin. Surewe  could have  motored  up to  the  dock and  filled her  up,  but where’s  thechallenge in  that? Yes  it was  hard work  carrying water  and rowing  back andforth. But we feel  better for having done it that way, we  got some much neededexercise and we feel less guilty about doing very little in the previous days.We still have to do a couple of  water trips in the morning, but that’s ok. It’snot like we have anywhere to be. I believe this is called earning a living…Our laundry is clean and we had a  nice shower - not that the shower on Taleisinis anything to complain about, we’re quite happy using it.The anchorage filled up rapidly towards the end of the day. We anchored where wethought we’d be out of the way. Since then we’ve been surrounded by boats of allshapes and sizes.","categories": [],

        "title": "Rookie Mistake",
        "excerpt":"With the weather  turning and the anchorage getting less  comfortable we decidedto  find a  better spot.  We spent  the  last few  days carrying  water back  toTaleisin. We did it the hard way, we  carried 20 Litre water cans back and forthfor a  total of  4 trips. We  rowed back and  forth and  loaded it all  on boardTaleisin. Yes we probably could have motored up to the dock and done it all veryquickly. That all sounded  too easy so we did it the hard  way. We got some goodexercise and I’m sure we’re better off because of it.We  got Taleisin  ready to  sail  this morning.  We checked  and double  checkedeverything. We put  a reef in the  main as it’s blowing around  17 knots gustinginto the  20’s. We  hoisted the main,  but didn’t cleat  the sheet  off. Feelingconfident we started to winch the anchor in, it’s a tough job if you’re not usedto it. I feel  like we’ll be better off physically in the  long run doing thingsthis way, rather than  the alternative. Time will tell if this gets easier ormore painful…We soon had the  anchor weighed and started to slowly sail.  Annie said, I thinkwe’re actually  moving backward.  No problem  I’ll hoist  the stays’l.  With thestays’l up we were going in the right direction! Great, we sailed off the anchoragain. This  time in a  bit more  breeze than before.  We didn’t even  start theengine so we felt pretty good.We were short tacking up  the harbour as the wind was on the  nose. It was a bitof trial and  error as we have  to backwind the stays’l to  ensure that Taleisinbrings her nose around properly. It probably  didn’t look to good from the shoreside, but we didn’t  care. We were sailing out of this  anchorage when most weremotoring. I’ll take that as a small victory.We had, what I thought,  a clean line to sail out of the  harbour. So I kept thecourse I  was steering.  Then things  changed a  little and  I recall  saying toAnnie. We’re too close to the headland, I don’t like this one bit, lets tack.We attempted to tack.  Taleisin would come around and then all  of a sudden justfall back. Something wasn’t  right! Not too worry, we have room  so we’ll try itagain. This  time with  more speed.  Taleisin comes around  and then  just fallsback. Ok, we’ll try again this time more  speed and give the helm all she’s got.Now we’re  getting a little tense,  this same thing happened.  Annie did suggestthat we gybe or start the motor, I  jumped, started the motor in what some mightcall a bit of a panic, and opened the throttle. Helm hard over, Taleisin finallycomes around! A huge sigh of relief, adrenaline rushing as we knew it was close.You can see  in the closer zoom the  3 attempts at tacking. Then the  loop as wemotored around. As I looked back from the turn I said to Annie, that was way tooclose for my liking! We made it out of the harbour without any further drama. Itwasn’t exactly a calm day out there, so we looked at each other and decided thatit was  enough adventure for  one day. Rather than  proceed to the  anchorage weplanned on,  we’ll turn tail and  run back to  North Cove. We sailed  into NorthCove and attempted  to pick the mooring  up under sail. We  were tracking slowlyenough until we  turned the corner and the  wind picked up and we  sped past themooring. Rather than persist I agreed with  Annie that the best course of actionwould be to just used the outboard and chicken out.The motor was already running at this point so we only had to put it in gear andopen the throttle. We motored around and attempted it again. This time coming inslowly with the wind  on the beam. We didn’t quite make it  as the wind blew thebow off. Ok lets  try that again. Again we motored around to  try the same thingagain this  time steering a  little higher. It’s  madness trying the  same thingover and over  again expecting different results, never the  less we’ll give heranother go just in case we didn’t learn the first time. Same result! Ok we’ll goround again.  Wait! What?  This is  madness! I turned  Taleisin hard  around andslowly allowed the wind  to blow us onto the mooring. I had  to put the motor inreverse to get us positioned just right. Success!We’re now safely secured to the mooring.  It’s gusting up to 20 knots out there,we’ve had time to re-evaluate the  situation. The adrenaline has worn off. Anniebusy cooking us a nice meal.Bottom  line:  Nobody got  hurt,  nothing  go  damaged  (except maybe  my  ego),everything actually worked out in the end.  We’ll take this lesson on aboard andgo  try again  when we’re  rested and  ready for  more adventure.  It’s easy  tooverlook the good. We had a few things  that we managed to do without any drama.There was only really one major drama.We might try again tomorrow!","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"When  you  own an  adventure  machine  like  Taleisin,  there’s no  shortage  ofadventures. After  our little adventure  with Taleisin  in Bon Accord  Harbor wetalked about the situation and what could have been done better. Sure, we didn’tbreak  anything and  nobody got  injured,  but that  doesn’t mean  that we  werecomfortably in control.We discussed it with Lin, and she shed some light on what may have happened. Linsuggested that  we take her little  12.5’ boat out for  a sail and go  and learnwhat the winds do when you get closer to the headlands.While waiting for  a bit more suitable  weather as the wind was  blowing quite abit and it was really gusty too! We  just kicked back and relaxed. We did have aday where we went walking on the other side of North Cove. It truly is a magicalisland. It’s  not in any way  related to the  timeline we’re used to.  It reallyfeels like  time has moved on  and this little island  is stuck in the  past. Weabsolutely love this place!Yesterday the  winds was a  bit more favourable  and Lin took  us out for  a fewminutes in Felicity. She showed us the ropes so to speak and then we headed backto the dock.  Lin sent us off on our  way and we spent the better  part of a fewhours out  there tacking  back and  forth into the  wind. We  gybed all  the wayaround to see how that would affect things and we got close the headlands to seehow the  winds shifted. Doing this  is a small  boat is a lot  less intimidatingsince running  aground means that you  can hop out  (she only draws 3  feet) andpush  her off.  Fending is  also a  lot easier  as she  weighs a  lot less  thanTaleisin.It was  a great learning experience  and it really  showed us how the  winds canbend  around headlands.  Experimenting is  easy since  the boat  responds reallyquickly.  When  the situation  changes  the  small  boat  lets you  know  almostinstantly. All  of this  is good and  well, but  was it fun?  Heck yeah!  If youhaven’t sailed a little  boat I highly recommend it. You’re a  lot closer to thewater, the boat  responds very quickly and everything is  very manageable. Whilethere’s winches on the boat, we didn’t have  to use them since it was so easy tojust handle everything by  hand. I’m sure if the winds  were blowing much harderit may have become required, but it would have had to be blowing a LOT harder.After we had our fill and the winds were picking up to a level where we would nolonger be having fun we decided to return to the dock. Since we were approachingwith the wind behind us we dropped the little main before we got to the dock andsailed under jib only.  We tried to glide into the dock  as smoothly as possibleand let the jib  fly before we got there and hopefully the  way would just carryus in. It didn’t  quite work out as planned, but this was  our first attempt. Wecame in a little hot, but since the boat is so small and light I could just grabthe dock and bring  her to a stop. This is not something  I would have been ableto do in Taleisin.We put Felicity away and closed her up and returned to Taleisin. This morning wedecided to sail to the Mahurangi river for a slightly larger adventure. It mightnot be  the smartest direction  to sail in  as we had the  wind on the  nose theentire time.Armed with the new knowledge about winds and headlands we were well prepared forsailing between  the islands to  our destination. We  could tell when  the windswere shifting and how they were shifting. We did a lot of tacking back and forthand had some  challenges along the way.  Nothing we couldn’t handle  now that webetter understood how the winds react.We sailed into  the river mouth through  all the islands and figured  out how toget in safely.  While we could have  sailed up the river, we  thought that sincethis is our first attempt at it we’ll play is safe and use the outboard motor toget us to  our anchorage. We kept  observing the winds as we  motored and talkedabout how  we could have sailed  it. While this  was less exciting it  was stillworth while as I’m sure we’re learning from it. Once we found the spot we wantedto anchor in I  dropped the anchor as Annie turned Taleisin  around to face intothe wind and set the anchor at the same time.Anchoring is getting easier and less daunting.  I guess I’ve read too many booksand stories about anchoring  gone wrong. It would appear that  if the holding isgood, it’s just a case of getting  enough chain out and allowing enough room forthe anchor to set.Whilst the adventure is  not as exhilarating as some of  the previous ones, it’sstill fun and the  challenges are just enough to keep us  on our toes. Hopefullywe  can  keep building  skill  and  confidence as  we  continue  to cruise  thiswonderful little boat.As an added bonus we got a special  treat tonight. We watched the sun set in theWest and  minutes later we watched  the moon rise  in the east. Tonight  is fullmoon, it’s quite spectacular being out on the water.","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"I’ve been warned about this before,  cruising with a schedule doesn’t work. Thisis more  true if you’re  sailing engine  less. While it’s  true that we  have anoutboard, we don’t carry that much petrol and when there’s a reasonable chop themotor is not much use.We broke a  cardinal rule of cruising.  Whilst we’re both taking  a timeout fromwork  at the  moment,  I’ve been  temporarily  sucked back  into  work for  someimportant business deals to get closed out.This unfortunate or  fortunate, depending on your perspective, fact  has lead tous sailing back  to the marina in less than  favourable conditions. The scheduledictated our  sailing day. Weather  plays an important  role in sailing  for us.Since we’re still  learning we don’t like  to sail in conditions  that is beyondour ability and comfort levels.I was looking  at the forecasts for days.  There was either too much  wind or nowind. When I finally saw a forecast that looked like we might be able to sail inthe morning and get close to the marina, we started to plan our journey.It’s not a  huge journey, it’s only  28 nautical miles to reach  the marina. Theforecasts called for 1 to 7 knots in  the morning with the wind dying down after10am. The winds were shifting between SW., E. and NE.The plan was to get up early and sail for as long as we can. If we don’t make itvery far we can always anchor closer  and hopefully wait the weather out to makeit home on another day.We woke up at  6am. and got Taleisin ready to sail.  We skipped breakfast optingto eat while under way. We weighed anchor and started motoring out of the river.It was nice and calm, compared to the  previous day. I looked at the clock as wewere motoring out, it was 7am.Once we got out of the river I said  to Annie, lets get some sail up! We hoistedthe sails and the wind filled them. We  closed the throttle on the motor and putit in neutral. That’s when the wind decided to die.Some numbers…  We had less  than a full  tank of petrol.  When we left  on ouradventure we motored  for 16nm. and used  most of our petrol. With  no wind thatleaves us 12nm. short of the marina. If you’re running the numbers, this doesn’tlook favourable.Plan A is to sail. Plan B is to motor to a closer anchorage and hopefully we canthen sail back to the marina before the heavy winds come up the next day. Plan Adoes  seem to  be viable  at this  stage. So  we tried  an experiment,  open thethrottle just  a little get  Taleisin moving slowly. In  theory we should  get avery long running time  on the petrol we have if we’re not  burning that much ofit along the way.We managed to  get Taleisin moving at  2 knots with the  throttle slightly aboveidle. We kept the sails up so that we could catch any puff of wind and hopefullyget a bit of a lift from that to move us along a little faster.This worked well  for a few hours, we’d  be moving along at 2-3  knots, a littlepuff would  come up and push  us along at 4  knots. We managed this  on the sametack all  the way through the  Whangaparoa passage. When we  were almost throughthe channel the wind  seemed to pick up. We turned the engine  off and sailed at4.5 knots! Awesome,  it looks like we might  make it home at this  rate, sure itwould be slow and take most of the day. We had no other plans so we didn’t care.Well, it  was nice while  it lasted. Five minutes  later the wind  dropped rightoff. So we sat  bobbing around. It was a Saturday and  this meant that everybodywith a power boat  is out on the water, since it’s  perfect conditions for theirpreferred type of boating. With power  boats zooming past us their wakes startedto make  it uncomfortable  onboard. We made  the call to  keep motoring  at slowspeed and hopefully we’ll catch a bit more wind.Motoring was fine for  a little while with a direct line to  our way point. Thenthe wind came  up again, but it  changed direction. We spent the  next few hourstrying to  motor slowly with winds  coming and going and  changing direction allthe time. We’re sailors, so we tack when we need to, no problem. We kept a closeeye on the amount of petrol we had left,  every half an hour we’d have a look atpetrol and  distance left. We found  some entertainment in listening  to the VHFradio on  the coast guard channel.  You can learn  a lot by listening  to othersradio in their situation.  Once in a while they would  broadcast that Ovation ofthe seas (a very large cruise ship) was anchored at some location that we didn’tquite know.  The broadcast stated to  keep 60 meters  away from the ship  at alltimes and to keep wakes at a  minimum. Slowly the situation started to turn morefavourable. So we decided to just go for it, and head for the marina!When we  finally made it back  to the harbour we’ve  already had a long  day andthen we finally  got some wind. We had  enough wind so we could  turn the engineoff and reach all the way to the marina. We were also moving a lot faster.This was all great  until we got to the Port of Auckland  docks. All of a suddenthe wind dropped  right down. This was likely  due to the fact that  there was ahuge cruise ship right in the middle of the harbour.Usually it takes  about 30 minutes to get  back to the marina from  here. Let medescribe the scenario. It’s Saturday afternoon, it’s perfect power boat weather.All of them are out on the water.  The location of the harbour we’re in has beendescribed as a washing machine to me  in the past. There’s power boats, ferries,ship’s tenders zipping back and forth. Combined with the huge ship in the middleof the harbour. This is chaos. We have no wind to sail with, which we need sincethe motor is no use because of the chop. Basically we’re in the most challengingsituation we’ve been in to date. The right thing to do would have been to anchorsomewhere  and wait  for more  favourable conditions.  Cruising with  a scheduledoesn’t work.We still have our  sails set, since we need to sail in  this spot. We still havethe motor going since we have no wind  and we can’t be floating around this areaas it’s  busy. Annie’s  sitting by the  outboard throttle to  close it  when themotor lifts out  of the water. I’m trying  to keep the boat on  course and avoidcollision since power boat skippers for some reason like to pass really close byand they  seem to  like crossing  in front of  us. Given  that we’re  not reallysailing we don’t have right of way  since we’re technically a power boat at thispoint.We’re moving very slowly, we’re trying to figure out the best course to steer toget out  of this  mess as  quickly as possible.  Given the  huge ship  the windsbecame very  fluky. Without any warning  we’d suddenly have our  head sails backwinded and our bow pushed over. Given the tendency of power boats to pass reallyclose to  us, this became a  very challenging situation  as the wind can  put usinto a  possible collision at any  moment. That means  we have to tack  and alsokeep the motor under  control. Since the winds are light we  had both head sailsup, this meant we had quite a few things to deal with and quickly. As soon as wefinished the operation the wind would shift  and we’d do it all over again. Thisprocess was repeated relentlessly. We were  tacking back and forth, motoring fora few second and sailing for a few seconds. Then another boat would come by. Thewakes would rock  the boat back and  forth and bounce up and  down. Tack, motor,dodge a boat. Tack, motor, doge, repeat. It seemed like it was never ending.It took us  2 hours to get through  this little section of the  harbour. We wereabsolutely exhausted by it, after we’ve already been out in the sun all day.When we finally got  past the cruise ship the wind picked  up, the direction wasstable and  we sailed right to  the marina entrance.  I dropped the jib  and themain. Annie steered  us into the marina  while still under stays’l.  Once we gotinto flat clam water and the motor was working properly, I dropped the stays’l.At this point I took over the helm from  Annie and we slowly made our way to ourslip. Slow and  easy. I managed to  put Taleisin into the slip  with an absoluteperfect landing. Annie grabbed the mooring  lines and secured Taleisin. I lookedat the clock  and it was 5pm. It  felt great to do this with  precision! I justwish the  usual spectators were  there to witness it.  It would seem  people areonly ever watching when I make a mess of things.It was a nice calm day. We had the most challenging day of sailing to date. Thisturned out to  be a big adventure, even  though it was only a  short distance tocover. We were absolutely exhausted! We both slept very well that night!The moral of the story here is not  to have more petrol, but you can be forgivenfor thinking that. The  real moral of the story here is that  you cannot allow aschedule to  dictate your cruising. Sure,  if we had  a boat with an  inboard wecould have motored all the way back at  7 knots and made the journey in 4 hours.It would have been uneventful and no  big deal. Instead we got a huge adventure,we got challenged.  We managed to get  through the challenge and  it felt great.Because of the choices we make, it’s possible to have adventures all the time ornone of the  time. Things that make  certain tasks easier also takes  a lot awayfrom it. We could choose the easy way or we could choose adventure…As a final comment,  there was only one power boat that was  truly a pain in therear, the big  one disrupting the winds.  The other ones are just  part of life.Regardless it still contributed a lot to this adventure. For those wondering westill had about 3.5 litres of petrol left.","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"It’s been a while since our last water based adventure. The reason we’ve been onland for some time is so that we can avoid being on land for some time.Let me explain. It’s now been a week and a half since Taleisin has been our onlyhome.  We  spent the  last  month  sorting through  all  our  stuff and  sellingeverything  that is  surplus  to  requirement. The  rest  was  put into  storageawaiting our  return some day  in the future. We  got the smallest  storage unitthat we  could get away  with and  really only stored  things that we  wanted tostore. This was challenging as it  forced us to go through absolutely everythingwe own to ensure we’re not paying to store junk.When we  surrendered the keys to  the rental house we  still had 2 car  loads ofstuff that we had to deal with. It was either coming with us onboard Taleisin orwe would  have to get  rid of it  since our storage unit  was full. I  guess youcould say that we’ve completely de-cluttered and paired down to the essentials.A few things we’ve learnt in the mean time…Taleisin is comfortable, and not  just comfortable for cruising, comfortable forliving. I  agree that 30 foot  is a small boat,  but she doesn’t feel  small. Wehave had to adjust the way we do things, but it’s not been a huge hassle for us.We’ve been living  at the dock without electricity, other  than that provided byour 100  watt solar panel.  Honestly it’s not a  hardship, we love  the kerosenelamps and  cooking with LPG (aka  propane) is a joy.  The ice box does  it’s jobwell enough that we don’t miss the fridge. You can tell that Taleisin’s interiorwas designed to be  very liveable, I cannot compare it to  other boats but she’sperfect.Keeping a small space tidy is a bit  harder since it doesn’t take much for it toget completely  out of hand.  Combine this with the  fact that we’re  still busyloading stuff onto Taleisin and the problem compounds very quickly. We have justabout got  everything onboard now  and things are  starting to look  quite good.We’re still  a few  days away from  casting off as  we have  a few boat  jobs tocomplete before we can go. Then there’s the all important provisioning.The transition  has been significantly  eased by  spending nights aboard  in themarina and a 3 week cruise, without this it would have been much harder. We gaveup broadcast  TV almost  2 years  ago, opting  for on  demand streaming  via theinternet.  This actually  lead to  the  act of  TV watching  becoming an  activeengagement rather than it running  continuously and nobody paying attention. Theresult was  that we ended up  watching a lot less  TV than we did  before. TV isactually one of the things we do not miss.You might  be wondering, so  what do we miss?  Interestingly not much.  While wehave to walk 500 meters to the bathroom block for a shower and to use the toiletit’s not  a huge burden.  While we could  use the bucket  and wag bag  system onaboard we feel it’s just a needless waste.It’s raining  today, the first  day it’s really  raining while living  on board.This will be a real test to see just how inconvenient it would be to head to thebathroom block.  We had  to head  out in  the rain  a few  times today  and it’sstarting to wear on Annie a little,  but as with everything I suspect we’ll justget used to it and life will go on as it always has.Another  point  of   interest  is  the  psychology  involved   in  pairing  downpossessions, it’s hard!  Do not let anybody tell you  anything different. You’reforced to confront  your decisions about buying something that  turned out to becompletely useless, cost a lot of money and has absolutely no resale value. Thisimplies  that  there  would be  a  huge  loss  involved  and that  the  cost  orreacquisition would be huge as well, but the initial point was that the item wasuseless.  I do  not know  why,  but I’ve  had a  lot  of these  items that  I’vejustified keeping for many  years. I can now say that after letting  go of a fewof these items it becomes easier to let go of the rest. At some point it becomesharder to  hold onto  things than to  let things  go. Annie has  had to  put thebreaks on me as I’d just continue till there’s nothing left.Being at the point  we’re currently at, which is on the brink  of cruising I canunderstand why most people never even get  this far. It’s hard! Yes it’s easy totalk about cruising  and dream about cruising,  but it’s not easy to  get to theactual cruising. While  most people were supportive in theory  and thought it tobe  a great  idea.  In practice  we  found that  nobody really  wants  us to  gocruising. Both  Annie and  myself found  it incredibly hard  to break  ties withwork. While Annie had  the simple case of just resigning and it  was over for meit’s not that simple. As a person heavily involved in tech start-ups and being akey person from everybody’s perspective in  the ventures, it’s hard. I’ve had tosail back in  unfavourable conditions for meetings to secure  future business atcritical junctures. Now that  I’ve actually put a stake in  the ground and said,No more!  I could  sense the  disappointment in my  business collogues.  While Ipersonally do  not believe they will  struggle without me as  I’ve trained thosearound me to deal with everything I’ve  been dealing with. I can understand thatthey might feel like they are losing a lot.Family and  friends has been a  lot more supportive than  anticipated. I’ve readmany books stating that family and friends  are not supportive as they will missyou too  much. We  have, however,  not made  the mistake  of letting  friends orfamily believe  that this is  up for negotiation. This  is something both  of usdesperately need. It’s been a lot easier from the friends and family perspectivethan expected.  Those friends and family  reading this, thank you  very much forbeing supportive and understanding regardless of how you might really feel aboutit.  It  has  been  hard  enough  to reach  this  point  without  having  activediscouragement from you guys! We really appreciate it.Naturally those of you  reading this will want to know what  our next plans are.Well we have  a few months off, we  might head North, or South  depending on thewind  direction.  We plan  on  taking  things as  they  come,  we have  no  hugeaspirations to circumnavigate or  to round Cape Horn. Right now  we just want tolearn to sail  Taleisin properly and sail  her well. We need some  time out fromthe real world. The plan  is to sail till the end of the  season or until we getsick of  it, which ever  comes first. If  we manage to  reach that point  we candecide what’s next at that time!If you’re  considering cruising and  wondering at this  point if it’s  worth thetrouble. I  can’t speak from  experience, but I  can assure you  that absolutelyevery cruiser I’ve spoken to has told me that it was the best decision they haveever made. Surely if  it’s this hard to get to this point,  it’s got to be worththe effort.  The other  thing to  keep in  mind is that  if it  was easy  to do,everybody would  be doing  it. If  everybody was  doing it  we’d be  looking forsomething else to do as that would then be the real world…","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"A lot has happened since I’ve last written anything. This doesn’t mean that it’sbeen boring…On the contrary, I’m not sure what  to write about since there’s so many awesomeadventures that we’ve had. The only logical  thing to do would be to write aboutthem in  the order they happened.  Given that watches and  calendars get ignoredaboard, we’ll just say that the following happened some time in February.We packed up the  possessions we wanted to keep and stored  them safely. We soldeverything worth selling and gave away  anything that we couldn’t sell. The restwas sent off to the land fill. With the commitment made to live aboard full timewe got stuck  in the marina with some  bad weather. We had a date  to keep sincethe CANANZ group were having a dinner  in Warkwarth and they were all planning acruise up the Mahurangi river.We provisioned  Taleisin and played the  waiting game with the  weather and windgods. When ever  you’re supposed to be  somewhere at a certain time  and date itseems impossible to get  good weather for it. Looking at the  light winds in theforecast, we decided to leave a day earlier than required and hopefully make thetrip over two days instead of one.We finally had a bit of wind so we cast the dock lines off and set sail! It tookus all  afternoon to make it  as far as Browns  Bay, about half way.  We droppedanchor and were delighted  to see the movie E.T. screening  on the beach. Peoplewere out having a great time and it was just a perfect way to enjoy the sunset.It would appear that I’m starting to make a habit of going green the first nightat anchor. I suspect it has something to do with the boat moving differently andme messing about with Kerosene for the  anchor light. Annie’s always a champ andtakes care of  the things I’m unable to  take care of. Needless to say  I was inbed early that night so I could regain my composure for the sail in the morning.We got up with the sun the next morning,  this seems to be the way you live whenyou’re on a boat.  Unless we had a late night we’ll wake  up when the sun rises.We had a quick breakfast and set sail for the Mahurangi river. It was incrediblylight so we  had to use the motor  to push us along a little  while we collectedevery bit of puff we could with the sails.We had to sail  like this for most of the way. We  could see a squall travellingacross the  land and the  sky getting darker. Eventually  we decided to  get ourfoul weather  gear out since it  became quite clear  that we where going  to getwet. The  weather was nice  all day but  the wind was  not. Now the  weather wasturning bad and the wind was good. We finally had enough wind to get some decentsailing done. It was great we sailed most  of the way up the river and only usedthe motor for the final stretch as we  didn’t want to muck around in the shallowwater and potentially run aground.We made it to our destination with a bit  of time to spare so we kicked back andrelaxed waiting for the other boats to show up.Not having made the  trip up river on the tide before we  didn’t quite know whatto expect.  I thought we might  be OK to float  on up under oar  power alone. Itwasn’t until those  who knew better told us  that we’d take all night  if we didthat. So  we dug  the little outboard  out of  the lazaret and  tried to  get itrunning. After a little messing around we got it started.We  got ourselves  ready for  a night  out and  started to  motor towards  CloseEncounters, owned by  Stephen, who’s also become a great  friend. About half waythere we realised  that we forgot a  flash light and turned  back. Eventually wegot the  flash light and  attempted to  leave again. This  time we got  half waythere and the engine  died. Out of petrol. Luckily I brought  a little spare canof petrol with us for just such a  problem. Another couple asked us if we’d likethem to tow us since we appeared broken down. We suggested that they hang aroundto see if we could get going again before we turned their offer down.After filling  the motor up  we were  under way again.  We stopped off  at CloseEncounters for a  quick visit and then we  all set off in our  dinghies for whatturned out  to be  a 5 nautical  mile ride. I’m  sure I’d  still be rowing  if Ididn’t use the motor that night! It was a long dinghy ride, but it was fun doingit in with  others. We stopped off at  a boat yard and an old  cement factory onthe way. We did a little exploration and stretched our legs before we took tothe water again.Eventually we all made it safely into  Warkwarth and tied our dinghies up to thedock in the middle of town. We had a short walk to the pub for dinner.At dinner we sat next to another couple  that was out cruising as well and had agreat time talking  to them, their boat  is called Fantail. This  named ringed abell,  but I  couldn’t  put my  finger  on it.  Fantail is  a  little junk  rig,naturally I asked if  they were fans of Annie Hill? Their  response was, well webought her boat!  No wonder the name Fantail sounded  familiar, I recall readingsomewhere that Annie was sailing a little boat called Fantail.We suggested that they come and find us  the next day if they were curious aboutTaleisin.  Needless to  say we  exchanged stories  and experiences  about owningfamous boats.The end of the night had arrived, we paid  our bills and then it was time to setoff on the  river in the pitch black night.  I do not recall a moon  at all thatnight.  The stars  were  spectacular though.  At this  point  I should  probablymention that I’m night  blind so doing things in the dark  is always a challengefor me.We all hopped in  our dinghies, armed with flash lights and  a leader who’s donethis  before. The  couple leading  the  way was  fantastic, they  found all  thechannel markers and pointed them out to  us while they were happily making theirway down the river.  This is quite an experience, let me try  to paint a picturefor you. Three dinghies,  one had 5 people in it. We all  had flash lights, somebrighter  than others  - I  love my  1000 lumen  flash light.  The lights  wouldflicker on  and off, zooming  around like  search lights, picking  up reflectivemarkers and  then it  would go dark  again. We’d be  winding through  the river,trying not to run aground or get stuck in the mangroves. Motors would be whiningso we  couldn’t even hear the  other boats. It’s  pitch black, no moon,  but thestars were bright!  If you’re not careful  your motor would kick up  some mud orworse stall because you hit the bottom. It’s hard to stay right in the middle ofthe river since you I couldn’t see anything without the flash light. It was justblack.The entire trip went something like this, for us. Annie was laying down with herhead at the bow, face up. This allowed  me to look over her and also keep cheekybetter balanced.  I’m a bit  heavier than  I’m supposed to  be so it  shifts thebalance quite a bit  with the motor on the back. I’d triple  click the button onmy flash light to get it into  turbo mode. So naturally this would progressivelyblind Annie as each successive click is brighter than the last (I’ve changed thesetting since  then). Once the  light is  on turbo mode  I can spot  the channelmarkers and point cheeky between them. I’d  steer this course for a bit and thenI’d repeat the previous process. I found  it challenging keeping on course as itwas pitch black. Slowly I’d recognise the  land marks as we pass them in reverseorder and mentally try to calculate how far we have left to go.We were about half way along and  Annie realised that Close Encounters’ crew wasnot progressing  down the  river. We turned  back to see  if everything  was OK.Luckily they  just ran out  of petrol  and was busy  refuelling. It was  at thispoint that it dawned on me that I never set Taleisin’s anchor light, finding hermight be a problem.  I asked Stephen if he knew where his  boat was anchored andfrom there we’ll  be able to find Taleisin.  We anchored quite a bit  away as wewanted to  be out of  the current  for the night.  We followed Stephen  to CloseEncounters and  could see our convoy  leader off into the  distance, lighting uptheir flash light.Suddenly I saw a whole row of vertical reflectors lighting up in the distance. Iknew exactly  what they were!  Lin and  Larray taped reflectors  onto Taleisin’sspinnaker pole. I could reach this with my bright little flash light and find myway home! Not long after that we tied up to Taleisin and was relieved to make itall the way back. It was a fun and challenging adventure.The next  morning Chris  from Southern venture  rowed over an  invited us  for amorning tea and a  catch up. We had a most enjoyable time  getting to know Chrisand Liz. After sharing many stories and adventures we rowed back to Taleisin. Bythis time we felt the need to have a nap. We were obviously staying on for a fewmore days, it was a Sunday if I  recall correctly which meant that all the otherboats had to get back since they had work the next morning. We would be lying ifwe said we felt guilty watching the other boats sail off to return to work.Our nap got interrupted  when Bryan and Linda from Fantail  hailed us from theirdinghy.  It was  quite  obvious to  them  that they  woke us  up  and were  veryapologetic. Honestly we didn’t mind as we  were just being lazy. We invited themaboard  and showed  them  around  Taleisin. We  spent  the afternoon  exchangingexperiences on owning famous boats. Bryan is very knowledgable and I spent quitea bit of time  picking his mind. Linda asked us a question  which we were unableto answer.  The question was  what’s our favourite  and least favourite  part ofTaleisin? The reason for  this is that every time we find  something we think wedislike, it’s usually due to us  not understanding the thinking and given enoughtime we usually  figure out why it was  done the way it was. There’s  so much tolove about  Taleisin that it’s  hard picking a  favourite, the whole  package issomething special. This is a case of the sum is greater than the parts.We spent  a few more days  being lazy up the  river before we decided  to weightanchor and continue our adventure.","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"It’s been quite a  while since there’s been an update on  this blog. Rest assuredit’s not for lack of adventure, on the contrary, we’ve had too much!I’ve written quite a few blog posts, and they are long, very long and also quiteunfinished. Since they  are unfinished and not ready to  publish I’ve decided towrite something new.Right now I’m sitting in the Kawau boating club, waiting for the New Year’s evecelebrations to start.  I’m looking out over the water  at Taleisin and thinkingback to the year that’s has been.Here’s  a quick  summary of  the  adventures we’ve  had since  I last  publishedanything on this blog:      I broke  a finger while sailing  in 25 knots  and 2 meter seas,  naturally whiledoing something stupid.        We saved  2 power boats in  the marina on  a Sunday afternoon, our  neighbors oneither side of  us. The second one  quite possibly involved me saving  a life, Ihave the scar to prove it too.        We had a near  death in the family, then the adventures  really kicked into highgear.        Our ship’s cat was  finally overcome by his failing kidneys  after an episode ofarrhythmic right ventricular tachycardia.        Annie’s 93 year-old  grandmother passed away shortly after, she  left Annie withthe gift of getting to know her family.        At this point we were ready to run away and we had a trip to the USA planned for6 weeks.        We spent  4 weeks  in Alaska,  driving adventures,  and another  epic sailingadventure with  the usual things that  can go wrong. We’re  still laughing aboutit, so life is good.        After Alaska we spent a week  in Port Townsend and enjoyed another wooden boatfestival. At  this point we  changed our plans to  extend our adventures  in theUSA. This allowed  us to spend 2  weeks in Port Townsend with  the wonderful newand old friends we made.        Leaving Seattle we spent 21 days driving  down to Santa Barabara - CA, across toRoswell - NM, up through Colarado, then Wyoming and eventually ended up spending3  weeks with  Annie’s sister  in Des  Moines -  IA. This  made for  a 12  weeekadventure that was never planned. Naturally,  as always, we had a fantastic timedoing it.        After we  left the USA we  spent 2 weeks in  Sydney, being sick and  catching upwith both  our brothers. When  we returned home to  Taleisin in November  we weremore than ready to be back home.        Returning to Taleisin, we were faced with  the work required to fix the wood roton the rub rail before we could move. This lead to adventures in woodworking. Toadd more  variables to the  mix Annie  decided to strip  the bad varnish  off thebumpkin  and  redo  it. This  was  naturally  not  a  job compatible  with  woodworking…  We eventually managed to get on top of  all the work required and we sailed intoNorth Cove a few days ago. It’s almost  like we’re finally ready to take it easyafter a huge ‘adventure load’.Reflecting back  on 2017,  it was  an intersting year.  We both  stopped workingfulltime and tried  to do no work.  While we’ve been successful  in this aspect,we’ve been presented with challenges that would have been impossible to overcomeif we were still working. We’ve also been able to have adventure on a scale thatwe’ve never been able  to have before, due to work  commitments. While we’ve hadsome sad times with the loss of a  family member and our beloved ship’s cat, we’vealso had  fantastic opportunities to  get to know  some family that  we’ve neverreally known. We  might not have been  able to connect with all  our family thisyear, but at least we’ve managed to spend quality time with some family.While I  still have to write  about a lot  of adventures (breaking my  finger iscertainly a story worth telling), I  will get around to it eventually. Hopefullythis quick short summary will give you  some insight into the level of adventureTaleisin has brought to our lives.  While not all adventure was aboard Taleisin,it  was all  because of  Taleisin. Taleisin  was the  reason we  got invited  toAlaska,  the  rest  unfurled  from  there. The  only  caviat  was  acepting  newadventures as they presented themselves.I hope that  all our readers have had  a fantastic 2017, but may  2018 bring youbetter and bigger adventures!Happy new year!","categories": [],

        "title": "In My Defence, I Was Left Unsupervised",
        "excerpt":"Two posts in rapid succession… Something must be interesting…As you can tell from the title, this is bound to be good!Today I was busy refining some wood work I’ve been doing on Taleisin’s rub rail.Annie was  about to go talk  to Lin about  planting some flowers for  her (Annieloves gardening, Lin’s got  a garden that needs tending so  it’s a great match).Annie asked  me while  I was  working to  check on  the cake  she’s baking  in 5minutes and put the timer on the deck  next to where I was working. I warned herthat asking me  to do something while  I’m working on something  else is fraughtwith risk. None the less, Annie insisted that the task is simple!My instructions  were to take  the cake out  of the oven  in 5 minutes,  stick aknife in it  to see if it’s  ready and if it’s not  to put it back  in the oven.Seems simple right?Well let me tell you something about my  focus, when I’m focussed on the task athand, nothing can distract me and nothing else gets absorbed…The timer went off, I put my chisel  down and went below deck. I pulled the cakeout of the oven, as instructed. I stabbed  it with a knife (no, this is not whatcaused it to look like it does in  the picture), it was cooked. It seemed like agood idea at the time  to be helpful and take the cake out of  the tin (we use abread tin as it seems to produce a better  cake on the boat), I tipped it out onthe cooling rack. Disaster struck!How was  I supposed to  know that I  had to let  it sit for  a while? How  was Isupposed to  know that I had  to loosen the sides  first? How was I  supposed toknow that you  place the rack on top of  the tin before you tip the  cake out? Iwas left unsupervised attempting to do something I had no business doing….Needless to  say my  first reaction  was oh ^%$#,  she’s going  to murder  me! Iquickly put it back  in the tin, then I thought the only  smart move to be wouldbe to make a run  for it! I high tailed it up the dock and  as Annie passed me Isaid I’ll just save her the hassle and go set up camp for the night!Annie gave me a look and said: “What have you done?”I kept walking….Twenty seconds later Annie yelled at me from the boat: “WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO MYCAKE!!! GET BACK  HERE AND EXPLAIN YOURSELF.  You were only supposed  to take itout of the oven, NOTHING ELSE!”Naturally I was reluctant as a 5 year  old knowing they are being called over toreceive a hiding  for the mischief they  have just committed. I  skulked back tothe boat and started apologising profusely.Now if you’re  a guy, and you’ve been  in a situation like this  before you knowwhat’s going through my mind at this moment…I think it’ll suffice to say that Annie was less than impressed with me! I triedto explain that  it still tastes good and  we’re going to make it  look worse byway of actually eating it.Luckily I escaped this time with only stern words, next time I might be sleepingon deck or worse in the dinghy!I feel  terrible about messing  up the cake,  I didn’t do  it on purpose.  I waslooking forward to it as much as Annie. I guess I’ll have to wait a bit before Isuggest eating  it regardless!  It does  taste good in  spite of  the way  it looksthough! I wasn’t  going to miss an opportunity  to taste one of the  many bits Ibroke it into…On the bright side, we’ll save time not having to cut it before we serve it!","categories": [],

        "title": "Creating Adventures for Others",
        "excerpt":"We have been very fortunate over the  last few years with the opportunities thathave crossed  our path. Lin  has introduced us to  wonderful new friends  and wehave been  invited to  go along on  many wonderful adventures  (I still  have towrite about  many of  them). While  travelling in  the USA  we came  across manypeople and we invited many  people to look us up if they were  to make it to NewZealand. I recall saying to Annie that if  anybody does take us up on the offer,and I doubt many will, I will make good on my promise to take them sailing.Copyright Campbell/SeamansWhen we were about  to leave Port Townsend for the  second time (there’s anotherstory here),  we were  buying some  supplies from Admiral  Ships Supply  in PortTownsend and talking to a few locals. They enquired as to where we were from, wereplied:  New Zealand!  Another  customer  suddenly said,  we’re  coming to  NewZealand later  this year.  We got  talking and  discovered that  Brad is  a boatbuilder and he was aware of Taleisin. He told  us his wife was a huge fan of thePardeys and has followed Taleisin for a  long time. Since Brad was coming to NewZealand with his family we exchanged details. We told Brad that they should lookus up when they are in New Zealand and we’d be happy to show them Taleisin.A lot  of time  passed and  we’d not  heard a word  from anybody  we met  on ouradventures in the USA. We were starting to think that nobody was going to acceptour invitation and carried  on with life as usual. A few days  ago while we werebusy  pulling out  Sikaflex from  some deck  seams to  replace it  I got  a textmessage on my phone. It read:Hey Eben and Annie, it’s Brad from Port Townsend… my family and I are going tobe in Auckland  tomorrow and I was  wondering if you happen to  be around. Sorryfor the late notice… New Zealand has  been an amazing country and sadly we areleaving very late tomorrow night…I told  Annie that Brad just  got in touch with  us but he’s about  to leave NewZealand. We quickly decided to call him and  see where they were at the time andif they would be  able to come to Kawau Island for the  day. Brad said he’d haveto check with his wife first to make sure it was OK to make plans for their lastday. After a bit of back and forth Brad said that they were good to go and wouldsee us the next  morning. I sent them the relevant information on  how to get tous and how  to make travel arrangements.  When Brad came back and  asked if theyshould only stay  for an hour or a  bit longer, I said well that  depends if youwant to go for a sail or not.This last  statement caused a bit  of a stir in  the family unit. Coming  to seeTaleisin is  one thing, but sailing  on her is  another thing. I could  hear thetone changing in the conversation instantly,  this was a whole new adventure thatthey weren’t  planning on. The  excitement was  certainly building on  the otherside of the phone.Of course we still had a lot of work  to do on Taleisin, we pulled out four deckseams and we were still working on re-caulking them. It was a very hot day so westarted early in the morning but were  unable to do anything until it started tocool down. These  seams are some of the  longest on the boat and  we were losingday light. Both  of us were tired  but we had to  press on, if we  didn’t make acommitment to go sailing we would have left it till the next day.We pushed on and finished just as the sun set. It wasn’t part of the plan but wewere happy when we  were done. There were still a few things  that we could onlydo the next morning, but we felt good about it and knew it was not going to be ahuge rush to get things done. Given the excitement I heard in Brad’s voice aboutthe prospect of sailing on Taleisin, I was glad that we wouldn’t be letting themdown.The  next morning  when we  woke up,  I removed  the tape  around the  seams andknocked the top  off the Sikaflex with  a chisel, which also  removes the ridgesaround the  seam from  wear. The  end result is  a nice  smooth finish  and deckthat  is much  easier  on your  body.  I  had to  replace  the stays’l  fairlead(un-affectionately known  as the damned toe  stubber), which had a  seam runningright underneath it. I bedded it and fixed it back in place.Copyright Campbell/SeamansWhile I  was taking care  of the deck Annie  prepared Taleisin for  sailing downbelow. Not wanting our guests to sit around waiting for us to get Taleisin readyto sail we got  everything as ready as possible up on deck.  The only thing leftto do was  get the 2 kids in  life jackets, row the family over  to Taleisin anddrop the mooring so we could leave.We had earlier  managed to find a  place to borrow child sized  life jackets andwent  to retrieve  those so  that we’re  ready as  soon as  Brad and  his familyarrived.We didn’t have to wait long for our  guests to arrive, I met them on Lin’s jettyand explained that  in New Zealand it’s  the law for kids to  wear life jackets.Adults is  at the skippers  discretion. Given that all  the adults could  swim Ididn’t force them to wear life jackets since the water was calm.We rowed  over to  Taleisin and Brad  and Kirsten were  very excited.  They keptthanking us  for going out of  our way and saying  what a big deal  this was forthem. We just smiled and said we were glad they could make it, but really shouldhave contacted us earlier as there  were missed opportunities. Kirsten gave Bradthe look, if you’re a guy you’re familiar with the look.Copyright Campbell/SeamansBrad and  Kirsten were  bursting at the  seams and asked  to see  Taleisin belowdeck. We all went down below and they were smiling from ear to ear. Kirsten keptrepeating, is this  real, is this really happening? While  Brad and Kirsten werebusy trying to take  in all the details on Taleisin and telling  us how lucky weare to own her,  their youngest, Angus, popped his head  into the companion way.He looked me straight in  the eye and said: Are you going to  take me for a boatride or what?Mum and dad were  quick to tell him that he’s not in  charge, but it was awesometo see  his enthusiasm to get  out on the water!  We informed him that  we’ll begoing out soon  and that he’s just got  to be patient a little  longer. I’m surethat the time  we spent down below was  far too short for Brad  and Kirsten, butnone the less I said that we should get  ready to cast off if they wanted to getout on the water.Copyright Campbell/SeamansEverybody was  very excited  all of  a sudden.  We started  the outboard  up anddropped the mooring line. We were soon on our way out of North Cove. Since therewasn’t  much wind  we  opted to  motor  as we  could have  taken  up the  entireafternoon just trying to get out of the Cove.Copyright Campbell/SeamansAs soon  as we got out  of North Cove  we got the  sails up. I offered  Brad thehelm, which  he eagerly  accepted and  we were  off on  a sailing  adventure. Wetaught them how to  manage the lines on Taleisin and we sat  back and relaxed.I could actually stroll  around the deck and  trim the sails to my  liking. Itwas really nice to have crew while I messed around with the details.Copyright Campbell/SeamansUnfortunately it wasn’t long before young Angus  felt a little green, we put himdown below  on a pilot  berth and mum  went to keep  him company. While  mum andAngus  were down  below, Luella  was  finding her  groove on  deck. She  quicklydiscovered that if she sat on the companionway hatch that she was out of the wayof everybody, the motion was pretty good too, since she was closer to the centreof the boat. She  lay herself across the hatch and had the  biggest smile on herface.Copyright Campbell/SeamansIt was around  the half way mark of  our sail that Luella said “Dad,  can we buythis boat”? Having  people offer to buy Taleisin  is nothing new to us,  but a 9year old girl offering  to buy her is quite new to us.  She clearly fell in lovewith Taleisin and commented on the fact that this boat is for adventures! I justsmiled and  thought to myself,  Taleisin is an  adventure machine, even  a youngchild can see that.Brad  got Luella  to take  the helm  under close  supervision and  it was  quitesurprising to  see that  even a  small child  could steer  the boat.  Granted weweren’t doing  7 knots+ which  makes it quite  a bit harder  to steer, but  at 5knots she was doing just fine.Brad offered Kirsten the helm and soon the  whole family was up on deck again. Icould tell this was a dream come true for Kirsten, she loved every moment of it.We sailed  around a  bit longer  before we  decided that  it’s probably  time toreturn to the mooring and ensure that the family is ready for the ferry.When we retuned to  the mooring Annie and I worked swiftly  to put Taleisin backin order so  we could get the  boom tent up and  our guests out of  the hot sun.While we  were kicking back in  the cockpit Lin stopped  by on her way  out to ameeting. Lin recognised Kirsten and they had a bit of a chat. Lin suggested thatwe give the family the tour of her property.Copyright Campbell/SeamansWhen we  were about to  say out good  byes Kirsten said”  “we don’t know  how wecould possibly repay  you for this”. Both  Annie and I smiled and  said that theway to repay us  would be to pay it forward. If it  wasn’t for others showing usamazing things and enabling  us to have adventures we would  not have had nearlyas many  adventures as  we’ve had.  We explained that  we’re doing  this becauseothers have done it for  us, and this is the kind of world  we’d like to live inso we’ll keep doing it.We feel very fortunate that we’ve come across many individuals who have gone outof their way to ensure we have a  good time. It’s impossible for us to pay thosepeople back  even if  we tried. The  only way we  can pay  them back is  to keeppaying it  forward. We saw  our new  friends off with  a warm feeling  and lovedevery minute of their pleasure. The whole family clearly had a fantastic day anda wonderful  send off from New  Zealand. It made both  of us very happy  that wecould put  the final touch  on what  was already a  fantastic 9 week  holiday inlovely New Zealand.  We also feel good  that we could pay it  forward to someonefrom Port Townsend. We owe this little town so much, the people we have met overthere are wonderful. If we couldn’t live on  our boat or live in New Zealand, wewould like to live in Port Townsend!","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"We’ve been a little quiet on the blog recently for various reasons. I wont gointo the reasons but lets just say it’s been interesting. That of course doesnot mean that I haven’t been writing. On the contrary, I’ve written almost30,000 words that I haven’t published yet. There’s a lot more to come, but ithasn’t been appropriate to publish it just yet.If you follow us on Facebook then you know by now, that Annie and I have madeour first ocean passage. This will be an abridged account of that passage. Whileit’s abridged, it’s a very long read. We will publish it in three parts overthree weeks. Those who support us on Patreon will get the whole pieceimmediately as a thank you for supporting us. The rest of you, patience isa virtue! You won’t be left out, it will just take a bit longer. Also goodthings are worth waiting for right?While the dream has been in the making for almost five years now, it’s been slowgoing. We started planning this particular passage in January while we werecruising in the Bay of Islands (I promise there’s something written about thattoo). At the time we were considering going to New Caledonia, but abandoned thatidea after talking to many other cruisers who said they were heading to Tonga.Also since we’re completely out of money (there’s another story there, and I’vewritten about that too), Tonga was the better option as we could do it with lessmoney.A lot of things delayed us quite significantly.  I had a contract on the gowhich was supposed to start at the end of January but for various reasons didn’tmaterialize until we already left Westhaven marina, bound for Kauwau Island todo a final refit in June. It got to the point where we just had to go or wewouldn’t leave. An unplanned trip to Australia over Easter set us back a bit toodue to weather and my car got stolen from the marina parking lot (there’sanother story there, and yes I’ve also written about that), while we were awayin Australia.  So we then had to deal with the aftermath of that.Refitting took a bit longer than expected as we had to redo a significant amountof fiberglass on Cheeky2 which we did not expect. There’s much to write aboutthe adventures here, especially when I let the smoke out of the compass (rookiemistake, but a story for another time).It took us far too long to get ready but eventually we managed to get on top ofall the jobs that had to be done at Kawau and we set off for the Bay of Islands.This was to be our first overnight sail as we needed to experience it before themain event (there’s another story there, but again not the one you’re here fortoday). Lets just say that it took us two days instead of one and it was anadventure which ended with us anchoring at 3 am.Once in Opua we had a few minor things to take care of and some finalprovisioning to do. We waited for a ‘good’ weather window so we could leave. Wehad a fantastic time in Opua but we were happy to leave.As with everything we do, we’re not just content to have the normal or average‘experience’. If we pay full price, we want the full ‘experience’. When youreduce your equipment down to the essentials and nothing more you get a muchricher ‘experience’. What follows is an account of what happens when you set offwith that crazy mindset.Without further delay, lets get to the main event…We checked out of Opua on Monday the 22nd of July at 10:30 am. It wassurprisingly easy. We had to leave the marina by midday. We’ve become incrediblylast minute when it comes to traveling and that bad habit has crept in the doorwith passage making. Taleisin was not hundred percent put in order for an oceanpassage but the major things were done. While we were motoring out Annie wasstill busy below stowing stuff properly.         View this post on Instagram          Some snaps from our passage A postshared by  Annie Ryan(@svtaleisin) on Aug 16, 2019 at 12:54amPDTThere was very little wind and we knew it would be a slow start. After motoringout into the bay we decided to take the new six horsepower outboard off (anotherstory to be told here), and stow it on the forward bunk to keep it safe whileout on the open ocean. This was much easier than anticipated and the water wasclam enough so that it wasn’t dangerous.Annie had prepared a whole big pot of chicken soup which we planned on consumingin the first 48 hours. This worked great for us on our first overnight passageso we thought we’d stick with a winning formula.Once we had the outboard stowed below, Murphy paid a visit and the wind dieddown completely. I had placed a Scopoderm patch behind my ear as soon as I feltthe slightest hint of seasickness. Unfortunately it didn’t work for me. Thatfirst night I paid the lee rail two visits while Annie was sleeping down below.Followed by another visit the following day. Annie was not feeling too goodeither but held it together and looked after me as much as she could. We endedup drifting and finding a few puffs of wind here and there. It took most of thenight to get away from New Zealand. I spent my watch laying in the cockpit withmy head on the deck box. I closed my eyes and opened them every five minutes orso to scan the horizon. This would be the first few days of night watches forme.Once we were finally away sailing for two days our InReach finally got activated(this was a last minute addition, we got a secondhand one and there’s anotherstory here for later). Finally we were able to communicate with Bob McDavittregarding weather. Bob’s comment was, I was hoping you’d be further North bynow.On day three we encountered some heavy weather and decided to heave to. We didit while there was still day light and got some rest while the rough stuff blewpast. Once Taleisin was hove to and we went down below, the change in motion ofthe boat caused Annie to visit the lee rail. After my third visit I decided thatthe Scopoderm was quite likely not working for me and removed it. I switched toSealegs but had to crush them in my mouth and hold it as long as I could to tryand get it absorbed into my body. That seemed to work rather well. The onlyproblem is I would be consuming them like tic-tacs for the rest of the voyage.When the rough stuff passed we finally managed to get a nice day of sailing in.We both felt better and were quite hungry. Annie said she felt like mashedpotato and disappeared down below. After some time she handed me a bowl ofmashed potato in the cockpit. I have to say that it was quite possibly the bestmashed potato I’ve had in my entire life. It could be that Annie had somehowmanaged to produce the absolute best mashed potatoes the world has ever known orit could be the fact that we’d hardly had anything to eat for three days due tobeing seasick. I guess we’ll never know.Annie also produced some chicken tenders which we had on bread, I swear it wasfit for a king! We had a really nice sail for the entire day. Then thingsstarted to pick up a bit. I sent a message to Bob asking what’s up with theweather as he’d told us to sail North West until the wind shifts. Bob thenproceeded to route us clockwise around a low pressure system. Things just gotworse for us so we decided that we’d rather not continue to sail and heave to,wait for it to pass and then hopefully we can ride the high pressure system thatwas following. This time we had to do the procedure at night and we were muchbetter at it than the first time. Both times we put the para-anchor out as wecouldn’t stop Taleisin fore-reaching. The second blow was worse than the first,but we managed to get going again sooner than the first time. At this stage wewere five days into the journey and had only managed to sail about two hundrednautical miles from New Zealand.Once we got going again we entered a high pressure system and Bob told us tosail North West until wind shifted. We had a fairly nice sail until we lost thewind early in the morning the next day. This is when we noticed that our batterywasn’t charging so there was something up with our solar panel that we lashed tothe dinghy. When we finally went to investigate we discovered that during allthe ‘drama’ the terminals got ripped clean off. The panel was flush with not somuch as a tiny bit of ribbon cable sticking up. We had another two panels downbelow so we swapped them out and started thinking about how we could fix thebroken panel. It was a nice calm day with very little wind for the most part.I noticed that the other panel wasn’t charging the battery either so I went ona troubleshooting spree. This involved me having to pull the battery out fromthe mount I made and lashed it to. It was a rather involved process and it wasalso quite hot. We were still dressed for the New Zealand winter as we hadn’thad warm weather yet. As a result, I had sweat dripping from me at a rate thatmade it look like I just stepped out of a shower. I did the only logical thingand stripped down to just my underwear. After the appropriate amount of cussingfor a job of this description and a couple of false starts I managed to geteverything ticking over!Since it was clam and I had an idea on how to fix the solar panel I decided togive it a crack. In order to appreciate the moment I’ll try to describe thescene. I’m sitting on the settee, just about stark naked, dripping in sweat. Thetable folded open with the solar panel on top of it. I’m holding a Stanley knifein one and and a flashlight in the other underneath the panel so I can see wherethe ribbon cables are. I’m slowly trying to cut through the first layer ofplastic on the panel to reveal a bit of the cable so I can try to re-attach it.After about fifteen minutes of struggling and cussing appropriately (I thinkit’s mandatory to get jobs like this done, if you can’t do it due to having toconcentrate ask someone else to just stand there and cuss on your behalf; I think that will also help), I managed to get the three cables exposed enoughto deal to them. I spent a bit of time checking everything with my multi meterto figure out what gets attached where.Still dripping with sweat and half naked, I dug out the little 150 watt inverterand soldering iron (this was an impulse purchase but turned out to be extremelyuseful). The boat was rocking since there wasn’t much wind but the swells wereat least consistent. Now I’m trying to balance the soldering iron on the tablewhile holding the required bits to solder on again. Luckily Annie came down tohold things for me so I could solder the cables together. Looking at the messbefore me, I now had to somehow ensure it isn’t too vulnerable. Inspirationstruck when I realized that it was originally stuck down with 3M 5200 andI happened to buy a tube of 5200 the day before we left. Just in case I neededit. But the problem was holding it in place long enough for it to cure. Theterminal box doesn’t sit flat and the gap is now huge because of the three blobsof solder.To be continued…","categories": [],
