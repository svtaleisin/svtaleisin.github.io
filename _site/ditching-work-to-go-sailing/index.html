        <p>So you wake up in the morning, it’s  perfect weather, the wind is just enough to
move  the boat  at a  slow  pace. You  think  to yourself,  “excellent, lets  to
sailing”. Suddenly you realise it’s Tuesday morning and you’re supposed to be at
work for meetings. So you make a decision….</p>

<p>I did attend the required meetings and  told everybody in the office, that’s it,
I’m going sailing  see you tomorrow! I  went home, had a quick  lunch and loaded
Ducky in the car. Annie and I were off to the dock…</p>

<p>I’m very  fortunate that I can  at times have flexibility  around working hours,
most of the time  we’re very busy and I have to keep  my nose to the grindstone.
I’m working towards freeing more time up  for playing. Annie is a school teacher
and she’s fortunately still on holiday.</p>

<p>We’re becoming  more efficient at getting  away from the dock.  We were motoring
towards Taleisin in  Ducky in no time  at all. Once onboard Taleisin  we got her
prepped for  sailing, we looked  at each  other. We each  took a deep  breath. I
hoisted the main sail. We cast off the mooring line. Taleisin fell off the wind.
The main sail filled and we were sailing!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sdki/24141559759/in/dateposted-public/" title="IMG_1517"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1467/24141559759_ca80f35045_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="IMG_1517" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<!--more--></p>

<p>Once we  built up a little  way Annie hoisted the  stays’l, I sheeted it  in and
Taleisin was moving well.  We only set the stays’l since we  just wanted to sail
at  a snails  pace and  enjoy  the water.  We were  not  going fast  but it  was
glorious!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sdki/23881140514/in/dateposted-public/" title="IMG_1518"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1660/23881140514_16466c906b_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="IMG_1518" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Since we were moving  slowly and just kicking back Annie went  down below to get
her fishing rod.  She sat on the  cabin top happily trawling  while we’re moving
slowly through  the water. I  could tell by  the look on  her face that  she was
quite content. I should point out that she was fishing and directing me where to
go etc…</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sdki/23881375394/in/dateposted-public/" title="IMG_1520"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1576/23881375394_afa50b1157_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="IMG_1520" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>While  Annie was  trying to  catch dinner  I was  happily sailing  the boat  and
tacking back  and forth on my  own. I’m sure it  was less than impressive  but I
wanted to experiment  and it was fun  and non threatening. It felt  like a great
opportunity to  do some  learning. We didn’t  spend a huge  amount of  time out,
maybe an hour or two. Then is was time to head back to the mooring.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sdki/23882532203/in/dateposted-public/" title="IMG_1522"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1476/23882532203_c1fd3dc935_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="IMG_1522" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sdki/23881134184/in/dateposted-public/" title="IMG_1521"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1506/23881134184_eb69c94f35_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="IMG_1521" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>When we got closer to the mooring field  we decided to drop the stays’l and sail
in under  the main  only. In  theory that sounded  like it  would work,  but the
current was stronger than our drive under  main only. Realising the error in our
ways we  had the stays’l up  again and made our  way into the mooring  field. We
dropped the stays’l again and attempted  to approach the mooring from down wind.
Things didn’t work out that well. Annie said, umm that boat behind us is getting
closer. The boat was not moving, we were going backwards.</p>

<p>I ran forward hoisted the stays’l, yelled  “sheet it in”! Taleisin picked up way
again and Annie was  able to steer us clear of the  few surrounding boats. While
she was doing this I moved quickly and maybe in a slight panic to get Ducky tied
on the quarter and get the engine running.</p>

<p>Once the engine started  to push Taleisin I dropped the  sails. Annie said, “The
boats not turning the right way”! Due to the fact that the engine is pushing her
in the other direction. I responded, “then  turn the other way”! Annie moved the
tiller, Taleisin  responded and  we steered  well clear of  all other  boats. In
reality we were never  anywhere near any of these boats  they were actually well
clear of us - it just felt like  they were getting closer. We probably had a few
boat lengths between us at all times.</p>

<p>Great, now  we have  control of  the situation! “Where’s  the mooring  buoy?”, I
asked. Annie  pointed it  out and  we slowly pushed  Taleisin towards  it. While
doing this is  became obvious that the wind  wants to blow the bow  off and just
using the tiller  alone was not going  to do the trick.  I started experimenting
and learning again. I found that if I moved the outboard tiller all the way over
I can  use it like  a stern thruster  and quickly point  the bow in  a different
direction.</p>

<p>We tried to get to the mooring buoy,  no luck, the current keeps pushing us off.
“Approach it so the current pushes you onto the mooring”, says Annie, “Like I’ve
already told you to do”. So we gave that a try, it worked, easily. I grabbed the
buoy and tied a line to it so I  could in theory relax and deal with things in a
calm manner.</p>

<p>Nice idea, I still  felt the need to haul the mooring line  over the bow roller,
tied another  line through the  attachment loop and  secured it around  a winch.
“Let’s get  this thing secured”,  after a  bit of effort  we managed to  get the
mooring attached securely. I turned to Annie and gave her a high five, “success,
we did it”!</p>

<p>I will  confess that  my adrenaline  spiked and I  was less  than cool  calm and
collected. Annie was a champ, she never missed  a beat! I needed to sit down and
collect myself. I  also had the greatest  feeling of accomplishment as  I sat on
the foredeck! Who  knew that something this simple can  feel this satisfying! Is
this what is meant by enjoying the simpler things in life?</p>

<p>We tidied Taleisin up, Annie put some salt water on the deck. We loaded Ducky up
and went  back to the dock.  Once we were tied  up I remember thinking,  “Wow, I
didn’t loose anything overboard”.  That was a bad thought. Just  as I lifted the
outboard from Ducky I noticed the trim rod  was lose and hanging out. I tried to
put the motor down to get it and at the moment it fell out and I watched it sink
in the water.  This is just ridiculous!  At this rate I’ll have  nothing left to
lose soon!</p>

<p>We  went home,  content with  yet another  adventure provided  by Taleisin,  she
surely is turning out to be an adventure machine.</p>
