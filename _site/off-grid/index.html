<!--more-->

<p>This morning  we decided  to sail around  to the Kawau  boating club,  seeing as
we’re  newly joined  members we  get some  benefits from  membership, like  free
showers, laundry and water. We needed all three of those.</p>

<p>We attempted to  sail off the mooring  in North Cove, but the  temptation of the
motor  was too  great. The  wind was  light  and it  seemed like  we were  going
backwards. We only had a short sail around the corner though…</p>

<p>We used  the outboard  to get out  of North  Cove and caught  some wind.  It was
really annoying  me that  we used  the motor  and it  felt like  we gave  up too
easily. So  we sailed under  full canvas around the  corner and into  Bon Accord
Harbour. Since I  still had the sour taste  in my mouth from using  the motor, I
was determined to get a win today even if it’s just a small one.</p>

<p>I said to  Annie, we’re going to sail  past the boat club under  full sail, turn
around and  come back to  anchor. For bonus points  since it’s not  blowing that
hard, lets try to do it under sail.</p>

<p>So we  had our plan, we  were reaching into the  harbour and then the  wind died
down.  We were  doing 0.7  knots according  to  the GPS.  It felt  like we  were
standing  still. We  could see  the club  house, but  it looked  like it  was an
eternity away. Since we weren’t in any danger and there was nothing around us we
persisted.  We were  waiting  for the  wind  to pick  up. It  was  a little  bit
frustrating and very tempting  to use the motor, but we refused  to give up. The
wind  finally picked  up and  we  were doing  4.8  knots according  to the  GPS.
Persistence paid off!</p>

<p>As we  sailed past the  club house we  picked a spot  to anchor, well  away from
other boats! I dropped the jib while Annie sailed us through the other boats. We
gybed and came back around under main  and stays’l. As we approached the spot we
wanted to anchor  in I dropped the main  while Annie kept us going  in the right
general direction. I let the anchor go while still sailing slowly under stays’l.</p>

<p>When we had a reasonable amount of chain  out and it looked like the anchor have
set I  dropped the stays’l and  let out some  more chain. Taleisin fell  off and
started to lay head to  the wind. We sat on deck for about  an hour to make sure
everything was ok.</p>

<p>Both Annie and myself felt pretty good  about anchoring under sail. We were also
the only  ones who sailed  into the harbour at  that particular time,  let alone
anchor under sail. I will chalk this one up to a successful adventure!</p>

<p>We spent the rest of the day  doing laundry and carrying water to Taleisin. Sure
we  could have  motored  up to  the  dock and  filled her  up,  but where’s  the
challenge in  that? Yes  it was  hard work  carrying water  and rowing  back and
forth. But we feel  better for having done it that way, we  got some much needed
exercise and we feel less guilty about doing very little in the previous days.</p>

<p>We still have to do a couple of  water trips in the morning, but that’s ok. It’s
not like we have anywhere to be. I believe this is called earning a living…</p>

<p>Our laundry is clean and we had a  nice shower - not that the shower on Taleisin
is anything to complain about, we’re quite happy using it.</p>

<p>The anchorage filled up rapidly towards the end of the day. We anchored where we
thought we’d be out of the way. Since then we’ve been surrounded by boats of all
shapes and sizes.</p>
