        <p>“Let’s go sailing in the dinghy” was  the words that Annie uttered on a Saturday
morning. The  weather was wonderful  and there  was not a  lot of wind.  She was
excited about the prospect  of sailing in the dinghy. I  was thinking to myself,
this is huge, Annie is pushing <em>me</em> to  go sailing. So we loaded the car up with
Cheeky’s oars and small 2.5hp outboard.</p>

<p>Getting  cheeky launched  was quick  and easy  and  we were  on our  way out  to
Taleisin in no time. You might be wondering why we’re going to Taleisin if we’re
dinghy sailing!?  The answer is simple,  of course, Cheeky’s mast,  rudder, drop
board, tiller and sail  is onboard Taleisin. Once we got  to Taleisin we grabbed
everything we needed to rig cheeky for sailing  and went back to the dock to rig
her up.
<!--more--></p>

<p>When we got back to  the dock I spent a bit of time trying  to figure out how to
make this little boat  sail. Granted I don’t know much  about boats and sailing,
it didn’t take much to figure out a way to get the pieces to fit so it can sail.
I was quite surprised at the simplicity. Lin  once said to me that a sailboat is
an  incredibly simple  machine, and  I  guess you  can be  excused for  thinking
otherwise looking at modern yachts loaded to the gunwales with complexity.</p>

<p>So having the boat rigged up and ready to attempt to sail her I went back to the
car to store  the outboard motor. I returned  to the dock and we cast  off to go
sailing. We had  a slight problem, no  wind. Don’t worry, Annie  said look there
are boats sailing out there, pointing to the harbor, lets just row out for a bit
until we can catch  a breeze. So Annie being the champ that  she is, grabbed the
oars and started to  row us out! It didn’t take long before  the sail filled and
we started sailing.</p>

<p>We were  moving slowly, but we  were moving. It  was very nice and  relaxing, we
went out into the channel of the harbor, tacked back and forth for about an hour
and then we decided to head back for lunch. We slowly sailed through the mooring
field and back to  the dock. Annie asked if we should row  back to the dock, but
me being as stubborn as a mule wanted to sail back. Slowly but surely we made it
back to the  dock and gently docked  Cheeky under sail. It was  a small victory,
but we  did dock under sail.  It certainly is  nothing like it would  be docking
Taleisin, but it was an achievement none the less.</p>

<p>Photos weren’t high priority for us, here’s a couple of bad “selfies”.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sdki/23864001004/in/dateposted-public/" title="IMG_1514"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1489/23864001004_e58fabac29_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="IMG_1514" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sdki/24196634050/in/dateposted-public/" title="IMG_1516"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1444/24196634050_998d234e74_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="IMG_1516" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Safely back at the  dock we started to disassemble cheeky and  moved her back to
the dinghy rack. Where’s  the car keys, I asked Annie?  We looked everywhere for
the keys. We couldn’t find the car keys!  I asked around to see if anybody would
know where they might get handed in if anybody found them. I eventually get hold
of  the on  site security  guard.  She was  a  lovely lady,  very friendly,  and
helpful.  After a  bit  of looking  around and  digging  through everything  the
security guard asked if she could call us  a tow truck to come and open the car,
at  this point  I thought  I may  have locked  them in  the car  when I  put the
outboard away.</p>

<p>With the tow  truck underway and me cursing  under my breath as to  how stupid I
am, I ran into the crew from Pinch  of Salt. I enquired as to the whereabouts of
their  dinghy. Apparently  they  have located  it on  TradeMe  (the New  Zealand
version of E-Bay) and was trying to figure out how to get it back.</p>

<p>The tow truck arrives,  the driver takes 3 seconds to open the  door. No keys in
the car, bugger! We paid the driver  the $80 fee for his services. What happened
next was unexpected and a nice surprise.  The driver offered to drive us home to
get our spare key for the car. We quickly loaded everything into the car, locked
it up and accepted the kind offer with a smile!</p>

<p>When we arrived home we had another challenge! The key to the house was attached
to the key for the car. We’re in luck we have a locksmith around the corner from
us,  a very  friendly guy  and  also a  sailor  (well this  is Auckland,  almost
everybody is a sailor).  I wondered over to see if he  was home. Slight problem,
he was out fishing for the day, but his lovely wife suggested that their 18 year
old son  bring the  ladder around  and climb  through the  window we  left open.
Success! We got inside, got the spare key and went back to the dock in our other
car.</p>

<p>On our way  back to the dock Annie  suggested that we stop and get  a cold drink
and ice-cream for  the security guard that  was so helpful and  friendly. It was
nice to  put a smile on  her face and she  really appreciated it as  the sun was
beating down.</p>

<p>So naturally  after we  got home,  I posted  a little  about this  experience on
cruisers forum. One  of the members pointed  out that it might  pay to sacrifice
some coins  upfront to the  ocean as  it would appear  that I’m paying  for safe
passage one way or another.</p>

<p>We had a great time, and it was another adventure thanks to Taleisin.</p>
