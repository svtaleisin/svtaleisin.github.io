        <p>When  you  own an  adventure  machine  like  Taleisin,  there’s no  shortage  of
adventures. After  our little adventure  with Taleisin  in Bon Accord  Harbor we
talked about the situation and what could have been done better. Sure, we didn’t
break  anything and  nobody got  injured,  but that  doesn’t mean  that we  were
comfortably in control.</p>

<p>We discussed it with Lin, and she shed some light on what may have happened. Lin
suggested that  we take her little  12.5’ boat out for  a sail and go  and learn
what the winds do when you get closer to the headlands.</p>

<p>While waiting for  a bit more suitable  weather as the wind was  blowing quite a
bit and it was really gusty too! We  just kicked back and relaxed. We did have a
day where we went walking on the other side of North Cove. It truly is a magical
island. It’s  not in any way  related to the  timeline we’re used to.  It really
feels like  time has moved on  and this little island  is stuck in the  past. We
absolutely love this place!</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Yesterday the  winds was a  bit more favourable  and Lin took  us out for  a few
minutes in Felicity. She showed us the ropes so to speak and then we headed back
to the dock.  Lin sent us off on our  way and we spent the better  part of a few
hours out  there tacking  back and  forth into the  wind. We  gybed all  the way
around to see how that would affect things and we got close the headlands to see
how the  winds shifted. Doing this  is a small  boat is a lot  less intimidating
since running  aground means that you  can hop out  (she only draws 3  feet) and
push  her off.  Fending is  also a  lot easier  as she  weighs a  lot less  than
Taleisin.</p>

<p>It was  a great learning experience  and it really  showed us how the  winds can
bend  around headlands.  Experimenting is  easy since  the boat  responds really
quickly.  When  the situation  changes  the  small  boat  lets you  know  almost
instantly. All  of this  is good and  well, but  was it fun?  Heck yeah!  If you
haven’t sailed a little  boat I highly recommend it. You’re a  lot closer to the
water, the boat  responds very quickly and everything is  very manageable. While
there’s winches on the boat, we didn’t have  to use them since it was so easy to
just handle everything by  hand. I’m sure if the winds  were blowing much harder
it may have become required, but it would have had to be blowing a LOT harder.</p>

<p>After we had our fill and the winds were picking up to a level where we would no
longer be having fun we decided to return to the dock. Since we were approaching
with the wind behind us we dropped the little main before we got to the dock and
sailed under jib only.  We tried to glide into the dock  as smoothly as possible
and let the jib  fly before we got there and hopefully the  way would just carry
us in. It didn’t  quite work out as planned, but this was  our first attempt. We
came in a little hot, but since the boat is so small and light I could just grab
the dock and bring  her to a stop. This is not something  I would have been able
to do in Taleisin.</p>

<p>We put Felicity away and closed her up and returned to Taleisin. This morning we
decided to sail to the Mahurangi river for a slightly larger adventure. It might
not be  the smartest direction  to sail in  as we had the  wind on the  nose the
entire time.</p>

<p>Armed with the new knowledge about winds and headlands we were well prepared for
sailing between  the islands to  our destination. We  could tell when  the winds
were shifting and how they were shifting. We did a lot of tacking back and forth
and had some  challenges along the way.  Nothing we couldn’t handle  now that we
better understood how the winds react.</p>

<p>We sailed into  the river mouth through  all the islands and figured  out how to
get in safely.  While we could have  sailed up the river, we  thought that since
this is our first attempt at it we’ll play is safe and use the outboard motor to
get us to  our anchorage. We kept  observing the winds as we  motored and talked
about how  we could have sailed  it. While this  was less exciting it  was still
worth while as I’m sure we’re learning from it. Once we found the spot we wanted
to anchor in I  dropped the anchor as Annie turned Taleisin  around to face into
the wind and set the anchor at the same time.</p>

<p>Anchoring is getting easier and less daunting.  I guess I’ve read too many books
and stories about anchoring  gone wrong. It would appear that  if the holding is
good, it’s just a case of getting  enough chain out and allowing enough room for
the anchor to set.</p>

<p>Whilst the adventure is  not as exhilarating as some of  the previous ones, it’s
still fun and the  challenges are just enough to keep us  on our toes. Hopefully
we  can  keep building  skill  and  confidence as  we  continue  to cruise  this
wonderful little boat.</p>

<p>As an added bonus we got a special  treat tonight. We watched the sun set in the
West and  minutes later we watched  the moon rise  in the east. Tonight  is full
moon, it’s quite spectacular being out on the water.</p>
