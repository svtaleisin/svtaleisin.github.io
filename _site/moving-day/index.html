        <p>We woke  up in the  morning, I said  to Annie “if  we’re going to  move Taleisin
today, we better get going. Not much wind  but it will pick up later today”. You
might  wonder, move  Taleisin where?  Taleisin has  been sitting  snugly in  the
marina all winter, as you might imagine  getting an 8 ton engineless boat out of
a marina can be a little challenging. We have recently had a new mooring laid in
a spot that’s easy to sail on and off. This is where Taleisin is moving to.</p>

<p>We’ve had some previous attempts at getting  out of the marina, one didn’t go to
well and the other  turned into a warping practice run. I  might write about the
first attempt one day  but the bruises are still visible on my  ego. In short, I
ended up in the water and I drowned an outboard.
<!--more--></p>

<p>So in  preparation for our adventure,  we prepared Taleisin for  sailing, talked
through our plan, had  a disagreement, came to an agreement  and we were finally
ready to  give it a  “go”. We did  all of this in  just 2 hours.  Given previous
experience I’d be lying if I said that  I wasn’t nervous, but I had to hide this
from Annie as it would make her more nervous, she was already not that confident
in my ability  to pull this little stunt  off. Not being one to shy  away from a
challenge, I just  dragged my feet for  a little bit building up  the courage to
give it a go.</p>

<p>Some people have  asked me in the past  how we deal with the lack  of an engine,
here’s the current way of doing things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Warp out of the berth</li>
  <li>strap the dingy to the quarter</li>
  <li>barge out</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/warp1.png" alt="Getting ready to warp" /></p>

<p>Notice the warp lines around the pilings.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/warp2.png" alt="Getting ready to warp" /></p>

<p>We pulled her out slowly using the mooring lines (not in the diagram).</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/warp3.png" alt="Getting ready to warp" /></p>

<p>Annie was in  the cockpit pulling on the  stern line to turn the boat.  I was on
the bow pulling the boat closer to avoid the bow sprit hitting the pilings. This
was something that happened the first time we tried to warp out.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/warp4.png" alt="Getting ready to warp" /></p>

<p>It’s worth noting that the direction the boat is pointing in is the direction of
the channel. We tied the dingy to the hip and barged out.</p>

<p>So it’s worth noting  a few things that we learned from  this. Firstly we warped
her  out really  well, it  felt great!  However,  do not  put the  dingy on  the
opposite side of the  pilings. While there’s no way on, the  dingy will push the
boat  into  the  pilings (there  was  no  wind  to  push us  off  the  pilings).
Consequently we had a lot of fending to do, this is hard work if you’re moving a
heavy boat.  Once you have  way on (and Taleisin  doesn’t need much),  it’s very
easy to  move the boat  in this manner!  The original plan  was to push  off the
pilings and drift into the middle of the channel, unfortunately this didn’t work
out. Next time I’d get the dingy between the boat the and pilings (still need to
figure out how we’d go about this).</p>

<p>A few gut busting  seconds later Taleisin was moving fast  enough for the rudder
to be effective! I  looked at Annie raised a fist in the  air and said, the hard
part  is over!  Annie obviously  didn’t  share my  victory  as we  still had  to
navigate our way out of the marina and into the harbour.</p>

<p>Finally making it out  of the marina, Annie commented how she’s  very glad to be
out of the marina as it’s  been nothing but unpleasant boating experience inside
it. I can completely understand her point of view as it’s been super challenging
and we kept getting beaten down by Taleisin.</p>

<p>Our next  challenge was to hoist  the sails, luckily  we picked a day  with very
little wind.  Annie went forward  and hoisted the main,  it didn’t seem  to move
us… The  next minute a  powerboat came speeding by  at what was  definitely in
excess of 12 knots (harbour limits). The wake nearly tipped the dingy and almost
drowned the outboard. I leapt over the life  lines and onto the dingy to keep it
upright. We traveled  under motor a little  bit longer but the  power boats were
traveling way too fast and it felt like  we were inside a washing machine. I cut
the outboard and let the dingy trail  behind. I hoisted the staysail and went to
sit in the cockpit.</p>

<p>The ghetto sounder/chart plotter indicated that  we were traveling at 1-2 knots.
Since it didn’t really  feel like we had much in the way  of steerage I can only
assume that  the current  was pushing us  along. It was  interesting to  see how
quickly Annie’s dislike for power boats grew as we were drifting, she’s a proper
sailor now!</p>

<p>After drifting for a while and getting thrown around by power boat wakes for too
long Annie persuaded me  to put the dingy back on the  quarter and push Taleisin
towards the mooring. Once I got the  dingy pushing along we actually saw 5 knots
on the Dragonfly pro,  I’m guessing at least 1-2 of  those were current related.
It’s worth noting that the outboard was  only at half throttle and only 8HP. Now
that we were moving we were making great  progress, I also didn’t have to sit in
the dingy the whole way and could just steer with the rudder on Taleisin.</p>

<p>Approaching the mooring I hopped into the dingy and slowed the engine down, when
we got close enough I just let the engine idle and we kept moving slowly towards
the buoy.  Pickup was a  breeze. There  was only one  problem, this was  not our
mooring. Since it’s a new mooring and we’ve never used it we didn’t know what to
look for. But the mooring number was not the number I was given.</p>

<p>So rather  than panic  I got  the engine  pushing along  slowly again  and Annie
steered  us towards  another buoy.  We followed  the same  recipe as  before and
pickup was very  easy again! We secured  Taleisin to the mooring and  had a high
five moment!</p>

<p>So if  you’re reading  along and thinking  that’s the end  of the  adventure you
would be forgiven since  for most it probably would be. We’re  not most and this
is when we got seasick for no apparent reason. Taleisin was rolling quite a bit,
we still can’t figure out why. I was telling myself to just push through and get
everything stashed  away and tidied  up. Annie lay down  on the foredeck  and it
looked like a good idea to me. We  spent about an hour just laying there feeling
pretty horrible. I’d  get up from time to  time trying to keep on  working but I
didn’t have much luck.</p>

<p>Eventually Annie felt well enough to get back  to work, when I got up to try and
help I got instructed to lay back down as I was apparently not looking the best.
Annie soldiered on like a champ and put Taleisin in order!</p>

<p>We had  one task that  we needed to  do before we could  head for the  dock, get
cheeky<sup>2</sup> off her  chocks. I had a few attempts  at this and eventually
managed to get the  job done without going green completely!  Once this task was
done we loaded up the dingy with everything we needed to take back with us, then
we learnt something interesting….</p>

<p>As soon  as we got on  the dingy the seasickness  was gone. Since the  motion of
the  dingy  was  different to  the  motion  of  Taleisin  we felt  better,  next
time  I’m getting  in  the dingy!  Motoring  back  to the  dock  we were  towing
Cheeky<sup>2</sup>,  eventually getting  back to  the  dock the  packing up  and
loading the  car up  took a  while. Approximately  8 hours  after we  started we
finished by  stopping for lunch  on the  way back to  the marina to  collect our
mooring lines and other car.</p>
