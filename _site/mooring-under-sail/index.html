        <p>We got  up early today  to go sailing  on Taleisin! We  loaded the car  with our
inflatable  training wheels  and made  our  way to  the dock.  We started  going
through the motions of assembling the ducky to transport us out to Taleisin. The
reason we  had to get up  early was to make  our way out to  Taleisin to collect
another life jacket. The extra life jacket  was for Bud, a classic sail maker in
Auckland from  <a href="http://www.naldersails.com">Nalder sails</a>.  I’ve been  told that
Bud is  an expert  in the field  of classic  sail making, he’s  an old  salt and
absolutely loves the classics.
<!--more--></p>

<p>On board Taleisin  we started to get  her ready to go sailing,  undoing the sail
covers, running the sheets, putting the tiller in place, the usual things you do
before you go sailing. Bud called to tell me he’s running a little late. We were
fine with that  as we were just hanging  out on Taleisin and it was  a nice day.
Unfortunately for us Taleisin is moored in a spot where the sea state is exactly
right to induce motion  sickness. Annie had already taken sea  legs and was just
chilling out on the  foredeck, I on the other hand, had not  and started to feel
the effects of sea sickness setting. This  was mostly due to me playing with the
y-valve in the  galley for the drain.  Rookie mistake, I know.  The smell coming
out of  it was  something awful  and made  my stomach  churn. Luckily  I’ve been
reading about this stuff and decided to get up on deck quickly. After some fresh
air I went down below looking for sea legs.</p>

<p>You’ll have to use your imagination as I didn’t take any photos, but there I was
laying  down in  the cockpit  trying to  regain my  composure. At  this point  I
thought it  might be best if  I headed back to  the dock to gain  some stability
back! I left  Annie on board Taleisin,  grabbed an extra life  jacket, jumped in
the ducky and went back to the dock.</p>

<p>Sitting at  the dock things  were getting much better  quickly and I  forgot all
about  that nasty  y-valve incident.  While waiting  a couple  of young  sailors
walked up and  asked me if the dinghy  tied to the dock belonged to  me. After a
bit of conversation they explained how they went out for a sail the previous day
and the  tow rope on their  dinghy sheared through.  The offered to pay  me some
money to  ferry them  to their  boat. I  politely declined  the offer  for money
(seemed like it  would be bad karma  to accept money for  something this simple)
and suggested that  if they just hang  around till Bud arrives  that I’ll gladly
drop them  off on  their yacht,  Pinch of  Salt. I  do have  to give  these guys
credit, they were about to swim out  to their yacht with all their provisions on
a float. They would how ever have to swim back to the dock.</p>

<p>Bud arrived, all for of us piled into  Ducky with all the provisions too. Off we
went! The crew  of Pinch of Salt was  happy once aboard and we  continued on our
way to Taleisin.</p>

<p>Once on board Taleisin  we hanked on the jib. Bud asked me  if I wanted to leave
under sail instead of  hip towing. My answer was “of  course”! Bud explained the
procedure and what he expected Taleisin  to do while we’re doing this. Basically
Taleisin is so sea  kindly and well balanced that we hoisted  the main, cast the
mooring line off and  she just fell off the wind and we  were sailing under main
only.</p>

<p>Once we got outside  the mooring field we hoisted the stays’l  and she picked up
speed. The  jib on Taleisin is  on a separate  stay from the forestay,  this was
done so that Lin  and Larry could deal with the jib without  having to go out on
the bowsprit while  rounding Cape Horn. We didn’t tighten  this properly because
the mooring line  was over the rope gypsy  while we were moored. I  was having a
bit of fun  and games up on the bow  trying to sort this out while  under way. I
can say this, I’m very glad that Larry put 8 inch bulwarks all around Taleisin’s
deck, it certainly made life a LOT easier  on the bow. To add insult to injury I
didn’t sort  the down haul for  the jib out properly  so I was running  back and
forth trying to  hoist the jib. After  screwing around for probably  a good 5-10
minutes with this I finally managed to get the jib up!</p>

<p>I went  back to the  cockpit, we sheeted  the jib in,  put Taleisin hard  on the
wind. It was glorious! It’s the first time we’ve had Taleisin under full sail! I
had the biggest grin on my face and so did Bud - not sure which of us was having
more fun! Annie was  hanging out in the companion way for  most of the duration,
only jumping out to help with sheets when we were tacking of gybing. While Annie
is no stranger to adventure and extreme sports, she’s a much better rock climber
than I am,  she’s not comfortable on  the water at all. She  should be commended
for agreeing  to buy  Taleisin and to  sail with me,  she is  absolutely amazing
because she  will push  herself well out  of her comfort  zone and  perform much
better than I ever could.</p>

<p>After tacking back and forth up wind Bud suggested we gybe and come up alongside
one of the old New Zealand America’s cup yachts. That was a bit of fun, but they
left us behind rather quickly! Bud showed me how to get Taleisin to run downwind
wing and wing. This will take some practice to do confidently!</p>

<p>Before we knew it  we were back at the mooring field and  Bud was explaining how
to come in under  sail. Bud made this look super easy! We  rounded up slowly and
ghosted onto the mooring buoy, I grabbed it  with the boat hook and then the fun
started!</p>

<p>There was quite a bit more load on  the line than expected, I couldn’t just hold
Taleisin in place, Annie came up to the  bow and asked if she could help. I said
get me a line so I can tie this damn thing off. Looking back I should have taken
a turn on something with the line and it would have been a lot less exciting! We
got it  tied off. I put  a line through the  bow roller and around  the windlass
rope gypsy. Bud and myself heaved the mooring  line up and we managed to tie the
line through  the mooring  line’s loop.  We ended  up winching  the rest  in and
eventually got the  mooring line secured. This was probably  the hardest part of
the whole experience.</p>

<p>With  all of  that  done we  tidied  Taleisin up  and  we spent  a  bit of  time
discussing  Taleisin’s new  sails. I  think  it’s safe  to say  that we’re  very
excited about  the new sails, they  should look absolutely awesome  and Taleisin
will have more  of a classic look with  them than she does now. This  might be a
bit counter to what  Lin and Larry would have done, but I  don’t think they will
mind too much, it’s all about making the old girl look really good!</p>

<p>The dinghy ride back was not quite as good. I’m a pretty average dinghy helmsman
and got the  entire crew wet in the chop.  In spite of all of this  Bud was kind
enough to  agree to mentor  us on how  to do things under  sail! This is  a huge
relief as doing things without an engine and learning that way is quite tough on
your own when you’re not entirely sure what you’re doing.</p>

<p>In the coming months  Bud will produce new sails for Taleisin,  we’ll be sure to
take some pictures of her with the new sails…</p>
