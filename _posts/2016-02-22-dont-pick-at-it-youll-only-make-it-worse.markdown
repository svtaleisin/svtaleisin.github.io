Haul out day has arrived. When we  spent a day scrubbing Taleisin before we took
delivery of her, Annie told me that we'll have to haul her out and sand her down
properly. As  always I should just  listen to Annie,  but that would be  far too
easy, it's a much better idea to charge off and learn lessons the hard way...

While talking to my father on the phone I mentioned that I might buy him a plane
ticket from Australia to come and give me a hand - I was only kidding as I would
never put him to  work against his will. A couple of days  later my father calls
me up, asking when  Taleisin is coming out of the water as  he's coming over and
give me a hand. Great I'll have extra  hands to do more work. Annie's father was
due in  New Zealand  shortly after and  he is  always keen to  lend a  hand with
anything  that  resembles  work.  There's  a  lot  to  be  said  for  the  older
generation's willingness to work, no matter  how soul destroying or miserable it
might be. So I started to make a list (oh how naive I was in my younger days).
<!--more-->

Mum and dad arrived the day before haul out. Annie was away on school camp for a
few days so I was  holding down the fort - well as much  as can be expected when
people are foolish enough  to leave me in charge. In my  infinite wisdom I ended
up booking the  haul out during the  biggest classic boat regatta  in Auckland -
Taleisin should have been part of it.  Never mind, it's booked people are coming
to  help so  I'm locked  in. We'll  be back  in the  water before  long, 2  long
weekends should  be more  than enough  and with many  hands to  help it  will go
quick!

Haul out was  much less adventurous than  I imagined it to be.  We simply walked
Taleisin  into the  cradle  and had  a  couple  of attempts  to  get her  seated
properly. I  probably drove the guys  in the boat  yard nuts as I  was concerned
at  every  step of  the  process.  Who wouldn't  be,  a  boat like  Taleisin  in
irreplaceable. A big thank you to the crew  in the boat yard for putting up with
me!

Once Taleisin came out  of the water my parents thought I  was silly for wanting
to haul her and paint the hull,  "There's nothing wrong with it, it looks good".
Then  came  the mandatory  water  blasting,  again I  was  very  explicit in  my
instructions, keep  the lance far  away from the hull,  I don't want  any damage
from water blasting! While the water  blasting process was taking place we could
see the anti fouling just flaking off. I'll be the first to admit that I thought
we'd just be fairing in a few bits here and there and then painting over the top
to get her back in the water with a nice smooth bottom quickly.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sdki/24368144710/in/dateposted-public/" title="IMG_1540"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/2/1700/24368144710_bdf0100f5b_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="IMG_1540"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

We went off to the store to get some supplies to get the sanding started. That's
when  the first  signs of  woes to  come started  to appear.  Touching the  anti
fouling in some places caused it to  flake off, hosing it down with tap pressure
only did the same. Other areas it was **stuck**.

We had to hand sand as they only allowed wet sanding in the yard. It became soul
destroying very quickly and  there was no visible progress at  all. When you get
something that looks like  it might be faired in some paint  would flake off and
you start  again. Poking and  anything makes it  worse, sanding in  other places
makes it worse. This is soul destroying work.

It wasn't  long before I realised  that we have to  go all the way  down to bare
teak. This was not  the plan! This job is much much  bigger than anticipated. So
much for the  list, now it's just  a matter of getting this  one task completed.
Taleisin might only be twenty nine and a half feet long, but she's a HUGE boat.

At  this  point  I  started  to  make  some phone  calls  to  see  how  much  it
might  cost to  get a  professional to  come  and do  the job,  most refused  to
touch  wooden  boats. There  was  only  one man  for  the  job, Alan  Boyd  from
[x-foul-e-8](http://x-foul-e-8.com). The only problem was that Alan was busy and
couldn't come and do  the job. Alan was kind enough to come  out to Taleisin and
provide very good advice.

After  Alan  advised  us on  how  to  proceed  we  had scrapers  to  remove  the
antifouling. Progress  was being made,  but it was  still really slow  going. We
scraped for 4 days, over the long weekend. Nobody in their right mind would find
this even remotely enjoyable. This is really  the dark side of boat ownership. I
believe it should be mandatory for any would be owner to clean the bottom of the
boat he intends to buy first, if you're still wanting the boat after that you're
good. It would  be interesting to see  how many people would still  go ahead and
buy the boat after that.

After the scraping we still had to sand.  It was at this point that Annie talked
some sense into me and I realised that it  would be cheaper for me to be at work
while I paid someone else to finish the  job. It's possible that one day I might
listen to her up front...

The hard  part was  telling my  dad that I'm  getting someone  else to  come and
finish the job, my dad is one of those people who refuses to pay someone to do a
job he can do himself.  I felt guilty having put him to work  for 4 days of soul
destroying work only to get someone else to finish it up. Thanks Dad for all the
hard work, I really do appreciate it, I still feel bad for letting you work that
hard only to  end up getting someone else  to finish the job! In  my defence the
work was actually far from over, it would have taken us a long time to finish it
up.

After a few phone calls back and forth  I finally managed to get a day that Alan
could come and do the work. Suffice to say  Alan made it look like it was a walk
in the park compared  to what we went through. The result  was awesome. This did
mean that  Taleisin was sitting  on the hard over  the second long  weekend with
nothing being  done too her. I  do believe everybody deserved  the break though,
the job was horrible and the pay was even worse!

The next  step was to get  painting done. Having  learnt my lesson on  the paint
removal part (also  I'll admit reluctantly that Annie was  the sensible one, yet
again)... I enlisted  the help of professionals for this.  They promised me they
would start within a  day or 2 of Alan finishing his job.  This was important as
it was  during the  hottest part  of the  year (yes  lessons have  been learnt).
Taleisin was starting to dry out and she needed some paint on her bottom.

Naturally,  as with  anything  that involves  a boat,  things  take longer  than
expected. To those well  versed in the drill this will come  as no surprise, yet
somehow I'm surprised every time! The  company doing the painting couldn't start
until the following week. While waiting on  the painting to start I noticed that
the seams are opening. This is not good news for a wooden boat.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sdki/27949524180/in/dateposted-public/" title="IMG_1548"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8848/27949524180_63ceebde7a_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="IMG_1548"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

At this point I stopped reading online forums, every man and his dog was 
reporting on my progress on the forums 
[here](http://forums.sailinganarchy.com/index.php?showtopic=171298&hl=taleisin&page=2) 
and [here](http://forum.woodenboat.com/showthread.php?171680-The-Pardeys-are-selling-Taleisin/page2&highlight=Taleisin). 
I hit a bit of a panic and of course knowing that the internet is watching I 
figured I had to do something and quick.

I pulled out  my phone and started with  A in my phone book.  I called everybody
that I thought might be able and willing  to help. I called Annie and told her I
was going to bucket  salt water onto the hull to get her  wet again. By the time
Annie arrived (50 minutes or so later) she saw this:

I think this was quite an unexpected  evening for most of my friends and family,
it was a great relief to have such wonderful friends and family! Most people had
a lot of  fun, sure it was  hard work. It's not  everyday you get to  be part of
something this  crazy though  (and when  I do  crazy, it's  usually on  a fairly
decent scale)!

The bucket brigade was a huge success, albeit a little redundant. The next day I
drove all  over Auckland talking  and meeting with  boat builders. It  turns out
that since Taleisin  has been in the water  for so long, a hose  would have done
the trick just fine as there's plenty of  salt in the wood. The boat builder had
a chuckle and said, "don't lose any sleep over it". Lessons learnt, but when you
hit a panic you solve a problem with the tools you have at your disposal.

**A very special thank you to everybody that answered the call that night, it is
very much appreciated!**

After some panic, running around, getting advice, hiding, and other shenanigans.
I finally  get around to  doing what I  should have done  in the first  place. I
bought  a lot  of shade  cloth and  hung it  around Taleisin.  This made  a huge
difference.

After about  3 weeks on  the hard the painting  finally got underway.  After the
primer went on I breathed a sigh of relief! The guys painting Taleisin was great
and got  a coat of  paint on before  the 3 weekend  started, this made  me sleep
quite  a  bit better.  As  with  the  guys in  the  boat  yard, these  guys  had
to  put  up with  a  lot  from  me.  A big  thank  you  to  the team  at  [Gloss
boats](http://www.glossboats.co.nz).

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sdki/27949514230/in/dateposted-public/" title="IMG_1559-2"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8677/27949514230_bbe7d71275_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="IMG_1559-2"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Next it was  a coat of blue anti foul.  The theory is that when we  start to see
blue on the hull  Taleisin is due for a few coats of  paint rather than just one
coat annually. Time will tell if this is a sound theory or not.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sdki/27949512700/in/dateposted-public/" title="IMG_1561-2"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8687/27949512700_7e0d8f23bd_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="IMG_1561-2"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Naturally this is followed by two coats in her natural colour.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sdki/28230177665/in/dateposted-public/" title="IMG_1567-2"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8777/28230177665_e39c9c6270_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="IMG_1567-2"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

After the  painting was  completed there  was one more  challenge, a  huge storm
rolled in. This was a pretty nasty one and a few boats ended on the rocks in the
mooring area where we keep Taleisin.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sdki/28230176065/in/dateposted-public/" title="IMG_1569"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8839/28230176065_b68362214d_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="IMG_1569"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The storm delayed  us getting back in the  water, which was fine with  me. I was
actually happier with  Taleisin on the hard  than in the water.  After the storm
ran it's course I was very sad to see that the little boat above was Patricia, a
carvel plank  H28. She went  back in the  water just as  we came out.  Her owner
spent a very long time fixing her up to get back in the water. I remember having
some banter  with him regarding engines.  He had to haul  Patricia again because
there was a leak around the prop shaft - I was a little smug about the fact that
Taleisin doesn't have those kinds of issues.  I was heart broken when I saw this
though:

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sdki/27614521804/in/dateposted-public/" title="IMG_1576-2"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7499/27614521804_fb3dc51a0b_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="IMG_1576-2"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


After what can only be described as a nightmare of 4 weeks long, we were finally
getting the old girl back in the water.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sdki/28230173915/in/dateposted-public/" title="IMG_1572-2"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8575/28230173915_c8a367ef2b_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="IMG_1572-2"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Getting  Taleisin  back on  the  mooring  was  rather  uneventful or  free  from
adventure if you wish...

A few days after I had finally got the  nerve to give Lin a call, I told her the
story. Lin had a chuckle and said: "Taleisin is a tough old boat", what I should
have done was given Lin a call from the start and save myself a lot of worrying.
It's how ever  very easy to be  reasonable after the fact, hind  sight is always
20/20.

It's taken me quite a while to write  about this ordeal, it's not always easy to
face up to your short comings and admit that things weren't always perfect. This
story  did have  a happy  ending, but  I can  assure you  that it  was a  fairly
stressful time for me. I have to admit  that the internet was rather kind to me,
it could have been so much worse!

Thank you to  everybody who stopped by  an offered support and thank  you to all
those  who got  roped into  helping  with something  at some  point during  this
adventure.
