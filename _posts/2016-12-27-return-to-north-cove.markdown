Our original  plan was  to sail to  North Cove yesterday.  But the  winds didn't
co-operate, instead we motored all day and tucked in for the night.

So, it turns out  that it was quite a bouncy anchorage,  easily corrected with a
snubber off  the bowsprit. Whilst  this didn't stop the  bounce it made  it more
than habitable.

This morning I said to Annie, "I want to sail off the anchor!". We had the motor
in neutral, just in  case. I  prepared Taleisin for  sailing while  Annie cooked
breakfast. After we finished eating and  putting Taleisin in order down below we
winched in the anchor until we were just  about ready to lift it. We hoisted the
stays'l. Annie grabbed the tiller and when  the anchor was up she sheeted in the
stays'l. We were off without a hitch! I hoisted the main and the jib while Annie
slowly sailed us out of the anchorage. It was a nice start to the day.

The winds  were much better  today. We managed  to sail reasonably  smoothly all
day. Slight bit  of chop out in  the open water but nothing  like we experienced
when we sailed Taleisin to Westhaven the very firs time.

As we  approached North Cove a  little speed boat  zoomed right in front  of our
bow, I was  wondering why they were zooming  by so close and then  I realised it
was Lin in  Jay Dee. Lin took some  photos of us as we sailed  Taleisin into the
cove.

We motored around looking  for a spot to anchor. I picked a  spot that I thought
look good. We dropped the anchor. Then Annie said, I think we're dragging! Ok no
problem, we'll try again. Winch the anchor in and motor around for a second try.

We try it  again and same problem again!  Ok so this time we  weighed the anchor
and went further out than I would have  liked. We found a spot of clear water so
we can have lots of room. I drop the anchor. This time I'm not messing around we
put 35 fathoms of chain out! Now we're holding.

Lin did  come by and offer  us a mooring  that's available. I suggested  that we
move but  Annie thought that 3  attempts at anchoring was  enough excitement for
one day. Fair enough I figured! We can try to pick up the mooring in the morning
when we have time for more adventure.

Annie cooked us a lovely dinner and we're just settling in for the night.

Here's some photos of North Cove, Taleisin hasn't been home in some time...
