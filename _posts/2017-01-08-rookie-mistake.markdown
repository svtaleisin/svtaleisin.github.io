With the weather  turning and the anchorage getting less  comfortable we decided
to  find a  better spot.  We spent  the  last few  days carrying  water back  to
Taleisin. We did it the hard way, we  carried 20 Litre water cans back and forth
for a  total of  4 trips. We  rowed back and  forth and  loaded it all  on board
Taleisin. Yes we probably could have motored up to the dock and done it all very
quickly. That all sounded  too easy so we did it the hard  way. We got some good
exercise and I'm sure we're better off because of it.

We  got Taleisin  ready to  sail  this morning.  We checked  and double  checked
everything. We put  a reef in the  main as it's blowing around  17 knots gusting
into the  20's. We  hoisted the main,  but didn't cleat  the sheet  off. Feeling
confident we started to winch the anchor in, it's a tough job if you're not used
to it. I feel  like we'll be better off physically in the  long run doing things
this way, rather than  the alternative. Time will tell if this gets easier or
more painful...

We soon had the  anchor weighed and started to slowly sail.  Annie said, I think
we're actually  moving backward.  No problem  I'll hoist  the stays'l.  With the
stays'l up we were going in the right direction! Great, we sailed off the anchor
again. This  time in a  bit more  breeze than before.  We didn't even  start the
engine so we felt pretty good.

We were short tacking up  the harbour as the wind was on the  nose. It was a bit
of trial and  error as we have  to backwind the stays'l to  ensure that Taleisin
brings her nose around properly. It probably  didn't look to good from the shore
side, but we didn't  care. We were sailing out of this  anchorage when most were
motoring. I'll take that as a small victory.

We had, what I thought,  a clean line to sail out of the  harbour. So I kept the
course I  was steering.  Then things  changed a  little and  I recall  saying to
Annie. We're too close to the headland, I don't like this one bit, lets tack.

We attempted to tack.  Taleisin would come around and then all  of a sudden just
fall back. Something wasn't  right! Not too worry, we have room  so we'll try it
again. This  time with  more speed.  Taleisin comes around  and then  just falls
back. Ok, we'll try again this time more  speed and give the helm all she's got.
Now we're  getting a little tense,  this same thing happened.  Annie did suggest
that we gybe or start the motor, I  jumped, started the motor in what some might
call a bit of a panic, and opened the throttle. Helm hard over, Taleisin finally
comes around! A huge sigh of relief, adrenaline rushing as we knew it was close.

You can see  in the closer zoom the  3 attempts at tacking. Then the  loop as we
motored around. As I looked back from the turn I said to Annie, that was way too
close for my liking! We made it out of the harbour without any further drama. It
wasn't exactly a calm day out there, so we looked at each other and decided that
it was  enough adventure for  one day. Rather than  proceed to the  anchorage we
planned on,  we'll turn tail and  run back to  North Cove. We sailed  into North
Cove and attempted  to pick the mooring  up under sail. We  were tracking slowly
enough until we  turned the corner and the  wind picked up and we  sped past the
mooring. Rather than persist I agreed with  Annie that the best course of action
would be to just used the outboard and chicken out.

The motor was already running at this point so we only had to put it in gear and
open the throttle. We motored around and attempted it again. This time coming in
slowly with the wind  on the beam. We didn't quite make it  as the wind blew the
bow off. Ok lets  try that again. Again we motored around to  try the same thing
again this  time steering a  little higher. It's  madness trying the  same thing
over and over  again expecting different results, never the  less we'll give her
another go just in case we didn't learn the first time. Same result! Ok we'll go
round again.  Wait! What?  This is  madness! I turned  Taleisin hard  around and
slowly allowed the wind  to blow us onto the mooring. I had  to put the motor in
reverse to get us positioned just right. Success!

We're now safely secured to the mooring.  It's gusting up to 20 knots out there,
we've had time to re-evaluate the  situation. The adrenaline has worn off. Annie
busy cooking us a nice meal.

Bottom  line:  Nobody got  hurt,  nothing  go  damaged  (except maybe  my  ego),
everything actually worked out in the end.  We'll take this lesson on aboard and
go  try again  when we're  rested and  ready for  more adventure.  It's easy  to
overlook the good. We had a few things  that we managed to do without any drama.
There was only really one major drama.

We might try again tomorrow!
