title: Crossing an ocean - part 2

This is part two of our ocean passage, see part one
[here](/the-post-most-of-you-have-been-waiting-for/).

Luckily Annie is smart and suggested that I dig out some clamps as she’s certain
there’s two small G clamps in the tool tray under the work bench. I dug the
clamps out and clamped the box down. I took the panel up on the fore-deck and
tied it down. I squeezed as much 5200 in the gap as I could and smoothed it over
with a Popsicle stick (another important set of tools we added recently to the
toolbox). We left the panel to dry until night fall and brought it down below to
continue curing for the requisite 24 hours.

I turned to Annie when the job was done and quite proudly announced that “This
will be one of my top five fixes while at sea!” We had a pretty nice day sailing
and we were starting to enjoy the passage. Unfortunately it didn’t last too
long, the next day we were actually sailing in decent weather but the barometer
was steadily dropping. That night things had built up to the point where we had
two small (not big enough to eat) squid wash up on the side deck. The seas were
also so confused that I couldn’t get the wind-vane to steer Taleisin and instead
had to hand steer for two hours before things finally settled enough for the
vane to work again.

I think I’m starting to master the wind-vane, it’s a fine balance of sail trim,
the right tension on the control line and in some cases the use of a bungy cord
on the tiller, which also might need more tension to either port or starboard.
It’s a delicate dance, but something I think is becoming instinctive to me now.
This is the first time we’ve used the wind-vane in anger on passage and I was
surprised that I managed to get it to work.

Things kept building until mid day the following day. We noticed that some of
the sail cars on the mainsail was detached and decided to heave to so we can
re-attach them. I started lashing the cars back on, Annie said, look up. The top
three cars we undone. We would have to hoist the trys’l if we wanted to have
a chance to fix these! We dropped the main, hoisted the trys’l and put Taleisin
back in the hove to position. I started lashing the sail cars back on as best as
I could. While in this position it became pretty obvious to us that we’d have to
get the para-anchor out soon. We set to task and we were very glad we did it
when we thought about it. Within an hour of setting the para-anchor things got
serious. The swells increased to five meters (imagine staring at a ten meter
wall of water when you’re at the bottom). On top of those swells were one and
a half meter breaking waves. We have no way of knowing the exact wind speed but
using the Beaufort scale and our observations we estimate the winds to have been
around forty to fifty knots. It was certainly a lot more wind than we’d ever
been in and we know for certain that we had sailed in thirty five knots gusting
forty.

At this point we sent Bob a message and told him we were forced to heave to, his
reply was, stay hove to until morning, then sail to a way point north east. We
intended to do just that. Through the night I didn’t get up enough to check on
our gear and the anchor rode had managed to chafe quite badly. This was due to
the fact that Taleisin tacked on us and the rode was running underneath the bob
stay. I though it would be fine since our bob-stay is basically covered in
a chafe guard. Little did I know that the conditions were so rough that it
actually managed to tear the top part of the guard open and pushed it up so that
the rode would happily chafe against the stainless steel wire. I noticed this
when Taleisin tacked back and we attempted to get the pennant in the right
position to try to avoid tacking. I shorted the scope to the point where I could
inspect the chafe, “Nope, cannot have this out there I don’t trust that it wont
break”.

Unfortunately this meant that now we’re on a shortened scope. It was morning and
we were considering hauling the para-anchor in and taking off. We thought we’d
have something to eat first since it was still quite rough sea conditions. After
breakfast we realized that we’re not going anywhere, things kicked up even worse
than the previous night. This time I went and checked the rode more frequently
and dammit, Taleisin tacked again. I kept moving the rode to avoid it chafing as
much but we managed to get another really bad spot of chafe on the rode. This is
crazy, we can’t keep doing this. I know we still have another spare rode under
the work bench but trying to dig that out in these conditions is a bit beyond
what my constitution would allow. We tried the best we could with what we had
and it somehow seemed to work. It was around this time that the first mental
challenges started, Annie had a crisis of confidence and a bit of an emotional
meltdown. Not because she was scared but because everything just seemed to get
to her. I tried to comfort her as best as I could and got on with the tasks at
hand. I recall saying to Annie at one point while everything was in full swing
as we headed up on deck: “It’s do or die out here”.

Later when people asked us if we were scared or concerned we’d reply with,
there’s no time for that sort of stuff, you just get on with it. Once the
weather cleared we got underway as soon as possible and we sailed Taleisin as
hard as we could. We decided that it was time to push on as fast as we could as
to avoid any more bad weather. Bob gave us a way point to aim for and we made
haste! As we hoisted the mainsail we managed to give the second solar panel we
lashed to the dingy a good crunch. You’d think that we might have learned from
the first time that we should take it down before doing stuff in rougher
weather. Seriously at this point we don’t deserve to have solar panels, we just
don’t seem to take care of them. Luckily it’s only cosmetic, it still works just
as poorly as before. This panel was the first solar panel we bought, it’s a 100
watt Solbian, supposedly the best there is. Well it doesn’t produce much power
any more. We were going to return it since it’s got a pretty long warranty, but
alas it’s now a very expensive souvenir. We certainly don’t have the money to
replace it either.

Over the next 24 hours Annie’s loss of confidence started to have a knock on
effect. Every time something got a bit challenging during her watch she’d wake
me up. This is absolutely fine as I’d rather she wake me than get in serious
trouble. Unfortunately it meant that I got hardly any sleep. This quickly lead
to me having a crisis of confidence thinking that we might have made a mistake
coming out onto the open ocean. I started formulating a plan to create a sleep
cycle for myself that will allow us to carry on without completely depleting my
life force. The next morning at around 7 am things kicked up again and we hove
to under trys’l only. I went down below and got some much needed sleep (still in
my foul weather gear on the cabin sole), Annie kept an eye on conditions in case
it got worse. A few hours later we were under way again. I made the decision to
sail under trys’l alone. I put Annie on the helm and got her to hand steer and
learn how to feel the motion of the boat in trickier conditions. She surfed the
waves for a few hours and then she set the wind vane. I’m not sure if this
helped or not but it seemed like her levels of confidence returned to normal
after that. 

Turns out that upon asking her if she felt better about knowing how the boat
handles, or about knowing what to do in those conditions she said, “I know what
to do, and that wasn’t anything new for me.  It’s just that some things you said
or have done have confused me so far.  I’m now no longer sure my judgment is
correct or if I am letting things go for too long.”  I just want to put on
record that Annie is extremely competent, her loss of confidence was purely due
to the mental challenges we faced. She’s capable of handling the boat on her own
in most conditions. She’s also the best crew mate I could wish for. The mental
challenge while out there is a strange one, and I cannot find the words to
describe it, unless you’ve experienced it for yourself you probably wouldn’t
understand it either.

We kept the trys’l up for the rest of the day and night, it proved a good
choice, we were still making good way and the winds and seas were quite variable
such that we were happy to keep going with the sail configuration. It also meant
that I was able to get better sleep due to the fact that I knew the boat was
configured for what ever may come already. All we needed to do to heave to was
sheet the trys’l in, head to wind and tie the tiller off. That’s quick and easy
and either of us can do that alone without any issue.  This also helped get
Annie’s confidence back on track, so it was well worth it.

The next morning we put a doubled reefed main and stays’l up which moved us fast
enough and kept the configuration manageable enough so we both felt comfortable
when on watch alone. Unfortunately, it was a bit rocky because of the wind,
swell and chop direction, but the sailing wasn’t too bad so we didn’t complain
much. While sailing along with Annie sleeping in the bunk I heard a bang. It
wasn’t huge since the wind forces wasn’t too high. I popped my head up and saw
the stays’l stay swinging on the port side. “Oh crap, get up Annie, we have to
deal to the stays’l!” I rushed up on deck to investigate. At first I thought we
might have lost the stay somehow (but I inspected it all before we left). Then
I thought that possibly the Highfield lever had undone itself, but that was
still in the closed position. Oh no, did the attachments on the bowsprit rip out
somehow? It couldn’t have there’s not enough wind to do that! I went up forward
to have a look. Nope it’s all still attached. Then I grabbed the sail and
brought it all in, letting the halyard go as I do that to make the whole mess
manageable. Once I had it in hand, I noticed what had happened. The cotter pin,
which has a spring loaded ball bearing to supposedly keep it from doing just
this had come out. 

Bugger! How did I miss that during inspection. Heck I replaced the bit of tired
string that held the cotter pin onto the rest of the assembly (good thing too as
we might have lost it). We worked swiftly to get it all back in place, but we
had an issue with preventing this in the future. Larry, show me the way! I said
to myself. I looked at the cotter pin again and noticed there was a hole drilled
in the other end. The light bulb went on! I need some kind of pin through there!
I looked at the forward hatch and saw a keyring style pin holding the hatch
cotter pin in! That’s it! I removed it from the hatch and applied it to the pin
on the stay! Problem solved. I placed the cotter pin from the hatch in my pocket
since we wont need it until we undo the hatch. 

I went down below to rifle through my rigging bag. There’s bound to be something
in there! Annie made the comment that the rigging bag is like Mary Poppins’
handbag, there’s all kinds of crap in there and it’s almost always the right
kind of usefulness when you need it! I found another keyring style pin and went
to replace the hatch cotter pin right away. By now we’ve learned that if the
opportunity to deal to something exist you do it immediately, it pays for itself
in the future. We were very lucky that this happened during reasonably clam
conditions as it might have done some serious damage otherwise. While it’s
a potential mishap we felt like we dodged a bullet here. We got lucky!

To be concluded…
