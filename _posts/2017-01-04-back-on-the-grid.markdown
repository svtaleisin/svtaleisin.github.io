Back on the tidal  grid! Since Taleisin is home and she still  fits on the tidal
grid at Lin's we decided that it would be a good idea to give the bottom a clean
and inspect the seacock that's been giving me grief as of late.

We got  the motor  going and  took Taleisin for  a trip  around the  bay, mostly
because the wind was blowing and we weren't comfortable taking the direct route.
We navigated our way through all the moored boats and slowly made our way to the
jetty.

I  followed Larry's  advice: "Don't  go any  faster than  you're willing  to hit
something". We came  into the dock very  slow and Annie climbed  off and grabbed
the stern line. I  had already placed the motor in neutral and  got ready to hop
off to  grab the bow line.  Then we heard  a loud crack. Whoops,  something must
have gone wrong!

One of the fenders got caught on one  of the cross braces and it snapped the end
off where  the nail went  through. As  a consequence I've  now got to  fix Lin's
jetty. It  was a case of  just putting enough  pressure on just the  right spot.
Luckily Lin wasn't upset with us so once we fix it, it will be all good again.

We  walked Taleisin  onto the  grid and  Lin came  to double  check that  we got
everything just right. Then it was time to wait for the tide to go out.

We were  invited to a BBQ  at 5pm and  low tide was  at 5pm. So not  wasting any
time, I just got to the task as soon as I could wade into the water and give her
a good scrub down. It was a lot easier  this time. There was no tears and we got
the job done before 5pm.

I  also took  the seacock  apart. I  gave  it a  clean and  discovered that  the
internal bronze  tube has  corroded away.  This is not  critical to  keeping the
system sealed up, but I will attempt to manufacture a replacement for it.

The hospitality in North Cove is still  great, we had another great evening with
the locals. Today we're heading to the  main land with Lin, hopefully we can get
rid of some of our trash and re-supply some fresh food.
