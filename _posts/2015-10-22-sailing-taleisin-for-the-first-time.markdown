This story begins early the previous morning. We had to drive 1 hour to Sandspit
to catch the  ferry which would drop us  off on the Pardey's jetty.  Once we got
there we  rowed out to Taleisin  like we have done  a few times in  the past. We
loaded our personal belongings onto Taleisin, only what we needed to survive for
the next 2 days. This meant we had some food and warm clothes should the weather
require it.

After loading our personal belongings on the boat we spent some time with Lin in
the boat  workshop. She  spent quite a  while explaining what  all the  bits and
pieces are that we should be loading onto  Taleisin. There was a big pile of it,
I remember asking Lin where it would all  fit. Lin assured me that it's all been
on Taleisin and that she will swallow it without any issues. After going through
everything in  detail we began the  long day of ferrying  everything to Taleisin
via Cheeky<sup>2</sup>. I  had a discussion with Lin about  the weather forecast
as some heavy weather was forecast for  the afternoon. We decided that we'll set
sail early  in the morning  and we should hopefully  beat the bad  weather, it's
only about 30 nautical miles to sail. Loading Taleisin took a very long and time
we were absolutely exhausted as we finished the last load in the dark.

We got  up as early  as we could  manage, had a  quick breakfast and  started to
prepare Taleisin  to set sail. I  rigged up a GoPro  and set it to  record while
this was going on.  Underestimating the battery life on the GoPro  it ran out of
power long before things got exciting. Below  is an edit of some of the footage,
there's not much going on but it will give you an idea of what was going on.

Something to keep in mind, Annie and I  have never sailed a big boat on our own.
We've had some  sailing lessons, been on  a couple of sailing  trips with people
who are experienced. That was about the  extent of our sailing experience on big
boats. I'm  very fortunate  that my  day job  requires me  to learn  things very
quickly, retain them, and put them to use almost immediately. This skill came in
very handy when it was time to sail  Taleisin out of the cove. Taleisin does not
have an engine, this  means there's a bonus challenge when  it comes to sailing,
everything must be done under sail or via sculling oar. Given that at this point
I've never sculled a boat in my life, we're sailing off the mooring.

It  was very  calm in  the morning  and hardly  any wind  in the  cove. Once  we
prepared Taleisin, I asked  Annie if she'd prefer to be on the  helm or drop the
mooring line. She opted  to drop the mooring line as  it was less responsibility
and something she felt was easier to do.

We stored  cheeky<sup>2</sup> on deck, hoisted  the sails, tucked a  reef in the
main and Annie  went forward to drop  the mooring line. I pulled  the sheets in,
pulled the tiller over,  took a deep breath... thinking "here  we go"! The sails
filled gently  Taleisin picked  up enough  way and we  started moving.  I recall
Annie asking, so when  do we start sailing? My response  was, we're sailing now,
it's just very slow, but we're sailing!

We slowly weaved our way through all the moored boats and eventually made it out
of the  cove. We  decided the previous  night that we'd  sail through  the inner
channel as it seemed like it might be more sheltered in case the weather pick up
as there was a  few islands that might provide some  protection from the rougher
seas. We had a glorious morning of  easy sailing, the winds were light the water
was smooth. I remember thinking, this is  what life should be all about! Sailing
is slow  going, it's  great if  you don't  have to  be anywhere  in a  hurry! We
removed the reef from the main and hoisted the big jib instead of the staysail.

Once we sailed  past Motuora Island things  started to get a  bit more exciting.
The wind has slowly increased and we  haven't noticed as we've been running with
it the whole way. The waves started to  build. We don't agree on the exact hight
of  the waves,  but they  were sufficiently  big enough  to cause  Annie to  get
seasick. The swell was  beam on, at no point did we feel  in danger so we didn't
change course. Taleisin was just taking this all in her stride. Annie spent some
time  hanging over  the lee  rail.  She eventually  recovered and  we sailed  on
towards the Whagaparoa passage.

At this point We  changed course towards long bay, the swell  was now pushing us
along and Taleisin  was surfing the waves -  this is a LOT of  fun. Taleisin was
very stable during  this whole experience! After  doing a bit of  fun sailing we
realised that  we should probably  sail around Devenport.  I went down  below to
grab the ipad to verify our position and  check out the charts on it. Due to the
sea state I rushed  back up on deck and I turned green  very quickly. Now it was
my turn to hang over the lee rail for over an hour. Annie did a fantastic job at
the helm while I recovered. At this point we're sailing towards Rangitoto Island
with the intention of jibing once we pass Devenport. It will be an easy run into
the marina.

Once we  got to Devenport  I said to  Annie, lets Jibe!  So we went  through the
procedure, started to jibe... That's when I realised that the wind was blowing a
*lot* stronger than we  realised. All of a sudden the heel was  far more than we
were comfortable. I yelled let the sheets go!  Annie let the jib sheet go, I let
the main sheet go, I pulled the helm  hard over, Taleisin came back up right and
I pointed her  into the wind. I yelled  out to Annie, get on the  helm, keep her
into the wind, I'm changing sails and reefing the main.

I went  forward, dropped  the jib,  dropped the main,  put a  reef in  the main,
hoisted the main and hoisted the staysail.  That felt much better, less sail was
a lot more manageable. Later we learned that the wind was 30kts gusting 35kts. I
took the tiller, let Taleisin drop off and we started to sail again.

From here  on out  the sailing was  actually pretty easy  going. While  about 30
minutes away  from the marina  I called  the marina up  asking the push  boat to
assist us getting into  our marina berth. I was advised to radio  once we get in
and they will come and tie up next to  us. When we got to the marina entrance we
rounded up into the wind, I dropped  the head sail, tucked another reef into the
main. This was when I had the most expensive accident for the day, the jib sheet
knocked my sun glasses off my head and  I watched them sink to the bottom of the
harbour  - I  had a  fleeting  thought about  jumping  in after  them, but  then
realised that it was probably a very bad idea. I yelled some expletives (see I'm
a real sailor now) and sailed into the marina.

Once we entered the marina I got onto the radio and the marina boat met us about
half way down the channel. They tied up next to us and we dropped the main sail.
I made the mistake of thinking that the  push boat crew would know what they are
dealing with. Things  got really exciting as they didn't  realise just how heavy
Taleisin is. We  had a few near  misses with other boats, but  eventually we got
Taleisin all tied up. We sat down for a couple of minutes to regain composure.

We went  down below, I grabbed  my phone and gave  Lin a call "Your  baby is all
tied up in Westhaven, all safe and sound". I recanted some of the adventures and
I could sense  that she was relieved  that we made it without  anything major go
wrong.

We learnt more during  that one trip than we did during a  whole week's worth of
sailing  lessons. We  had  to respond  quickly,  we  had to  think  on our  feet
(something  I'm fortunately  used to  due to  my day  job). More  importantly we
learnt that if things  go wrong get yourself into a position  where you can slow
down, think, regroup and solve the problem.

It would be remiss  of me if I didn't point out that  this story mostly reflects
the abilities of Taleisin and not that of  our own. I'm convinced that if it was
a lesser boat,  things would not have  been so smooth. We are  indeed very proud
care takers of this well found vessel.
