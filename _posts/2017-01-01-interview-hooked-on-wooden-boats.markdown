Looking at the  date, 2016 is finally over.  I believe a lot of  people would be
happy to see the back of 2016. Happy New Year, may 2017 be a good one.

Last year when we were at the wooden  boat festival we did an interview with Dan
Mattson.  It was  a bit  of fun  and  Dan has  just sent  me the  word that  the
interview is up on his pod cast. If you're curious have a listen

We're still hanging out  in North Cove, we got invited to a  small new years eve
gathering with  the locals. We had  a great time and  got to see parts  of North
Cove we've never seen before. This place  is magical. When we head over that way
again I'll  be sure to take  some pictures. Thank  you to all the  residents for
making our time here very pleasurable!
