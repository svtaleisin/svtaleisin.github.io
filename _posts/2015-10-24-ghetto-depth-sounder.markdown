Learning to sail a  boat like Taleisin is challenging at  best, learning to sail
on a boat like Taleisin takes things up a notch! Training wheels! That's what we
need!  While  Taleisin has  got  a  perfectly good  lead  line  on board  (still
functioning as well  as the day the  Pardeys installed it), we've  got plenty to
get right  without the worry  about how deep the  water is. Enter  the Raymarine
Dragonfly 4 Pro, now don't get me  wrong, there's no substitute for common sense
and we  fully intend  on moving to  old school navigation  and old  school depth
sounding. Baby steps are normally the way to start, jumping in the deep end with
a boat like Taleisin provides plenty  of challenge without the added bits around
the edges.

So after spending  some time searching around  and scratching my head  I came up
with this little design. It's a 25mm PVC  pipe with a 20mm dowel shoved down the
inside. It's a prototype, the idea is  that the dowel prevents the flex, and PVC
is pretty well suited  to being in water. I still need to  seal the bottom of it
using some  silicon or epoxy or  what ever will do  the job. It should  be quite
obvious  to  the  observer that  we  don't  intend  on  putting a  through  hull
transducer on  Taleisin and  that this  is just a  "portable" sounder  and chart
plotter.

Lashing the pipe to the transom as  a temporary measure, I will do this slightly
better before I take it out for a test sail.

I fashioned  some form of  plug and  play system using  an existing 12V  plug in
Taleisin. We're  not very keen  on altering  Taleisin without having  thought it
through properly. This allows me to play and if I choose to throw it out, nobody
will know any better (well maybe they will  if they read this post). I guess I'm
trying to say that the boat will not be harmed with this little experiment.

As an added little bonus, it's got  a GPS chart plotter for added entertainment.
This will provide  a makeshift set of instrumentation for  speed, depth and GPS.
While I could have  used an iPad - and I thought about  it, using some wifi type
transducer with the Navionics app. This would  have left me with the small issue
that it's not waterproof. After doing a lot of reading I ended up going with the
dragonfly instead, added bonus is that I can connect the iPad via wifi and still
have a larger  screen. I also think I  might get better battery life  out of the
dragonfly than the iPad, but time will tell!

How will all  of this work out?  I have no idea,  but if it works  it will allow
some training wheels  during the early stages.  Once we get up  to standard with
our skills it wont matter any more.
