It's been a while since I've written a post. I've been quite snowed under with a
lot of different projects and my mind was refusing to co-operate. I was asked by
[John Almberg](http://www.unlikelyboatbuilder.com/)  to write  a guest  post for
his blog.

It's probably of interest to everybody who's following us. I wrote about why we 

bought Taleisin. You can read the post [here](http://www.unlikelyboatbuilder.com/2016/04/why-did-you-buy-taleisin.html).
