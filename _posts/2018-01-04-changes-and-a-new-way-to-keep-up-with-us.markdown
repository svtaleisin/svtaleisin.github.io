I'm experiencing Deja  Vu, not that long  ago I broke the email  system. Today I
received another email about it not  working correctly. I do apologise for this!
I've added some more checks and controls to avoid this happening.

If you've received an empty email you can click through to the website and find
the last update in the archive section.

Since I was making changes to the blogging system I decided to add a few
things.
<!--more-->

The first thing you'll notice is that the site got a bit of a facelift.
Hopefully you like it, let us know in the comments.

We've created a  new [Facebook page](https://web.facebook.com/SVTaleisin/) which
will give you another  way to follow us. If you're a Facebook  user, Annie is in
charge of this page so you can interact with her directly via the Facebook page.

The  other   change  is   the  Patreon   button.  This  one   might  be   a  bit
controversial,  so  we  thought  it  best  to address  that  on  this  new  page
[here](http://taleisin.com/patreon/). We  don't want  this to distract  from the
blog and we're certainly not asking our  readers for money. We're treating it as
a motivation jar.  If readers want to  contribute to it to motivate  us to write
more regularly, we'll  respond accordingly. If reader chose not  to do so, we'll
keep carrying on the way we've been since we started this little blog.

We want to be clear  for the record. We do not want to turn  this into a job. If
we want another job, we'll go out and  get jobs. Treat it like you would treat a
musician on the street, you're free to listen as long as you want. Dropping some
spare change in the hat is optional.
