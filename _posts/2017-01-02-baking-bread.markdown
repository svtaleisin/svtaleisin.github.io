Today I baked  a loaf of bread. Very  exciting, I know. It's been  almost a week
since we consumed our  last bread and I've been promising Annie  that I'd bake a
loaf of bread. It's something I used to do a few years ago so the concept is not
new to me. How ever I've never done it all by hand without electricity. It's not
rocket science to bake bread. Yeast, a bit  of sugar, water and flour with a bit
of salt will be the job done. Use a bit of elbow grease and it's not long before
you have something that resembles dough.

The hardest part was figuring out how to get the oven on board Taleisin to do my
bidding. The actual baking  part took a bit longer, but I suspect  with a bit of
trial and error I'll get the hang of it. The loaf actually came out pretty good.
We've just about eaten  half of it already. Having said all of  that, it took me
the better part of the day to do it. It's the time waiting in between that takes
long, the work is minimal.

So far our stay in North Cove is  wonderful, the locals are friendly and we keep
getting invited to hang out with them. I'm starting to feel a bit guilty because
I'm being so  lazy and not really doing  much. Our aim is to get  out sailing in
the next few days and maybe go practice anchoring in the next bay over.

Another thing to mention is that rowing Cheeky<sup>2</sup> is getting easier. We
deliberately left the outboard at home to force us to row and get better at it.
I'm sure over time this will not be an issue at all and we'll be healthier for
it. One thing we have been doing is taking turns rowing. If I row out Annie will
row back. That way we both get practice and exercise.
