After some discussions on forums, it became obvious that I'd have to do a follow
up post on why I got a 20 hp. Honda motor.

There was a few variables that went into the equation.

Weight, Cost and Horsepower.

I looked at  the Torqeedo 4 kw motor. That  in theory was a good idea,  8 hp. in
cruise  mode, 10  hp. thrust  (which incidentally  Lin and  Larry said  would be
enough).  This motor  is about  20 kg.  Then comes  the batteries.  The Torqeedo
batteries are 24.3 kg. each, you  require 2. These batteries are very expensive,
so going with a lead-acid/AGM option you'd  need 4 x 200 A/H batteries (Torqeedo
batteries  are 24V  lithium).  Finding  space for  these  batteries  would be  a
challenge in it's  own right. Not to  mention that the costs would  be very high
for a  setup like  this and  charging would be  a challenge  unless you're  in a
marina. Even then  it's very easy to add  petrol to a tank, start  the motor and
go. Not  the same with batteries.  This is also  not a simple setup,  it's quite
complicated and at odds with the rest  of the boat. Incidentally I looked at the
10 kw motor too, that weighs 64kg and requires twice as many batteries, so twice
the problem.  Not to  mention 3  times the cost  without installation  costs and
brackets etc.

So the other option is to go  for petrol. I wanted something that's simple, that
means manual tilt, tiller steer and pull start.

The Yamaha  9.9 hp. has been  mentioned, I rejected  that motor due to  the fact
that it's  electric start  only (battery and  more complication  required), this
motor also  weights 49 -  52KG depending on  the model. So  not a lot  of upside
here.

Tohatsu is another one that was mentioned. The dealers proved challenging to get
a quote from,  at first. This lead me  to wonder what support would  be like, if
they are in sales  mode they are at their best, so they  won't get any better...
The motor  that was quoted was  not only 20%  more expensive than the  Honda but
also weighed 62 kg. It's worth noting  that this was a manual/electric start and
also a manual/power tilt - which explains the weight.

Honda, I looked at  the 8/10 hp which is the same  motor just tuned differently,
this was 48 kg. The 15/20 hp. which  is the same motor just tuned differently at
52 kg.

These are the only motors I'll mention as inboards were not an option due to the
required hole(s) in the hull. Other manufacturers didn't do 25" shafts.

At the end  of the day the weight  vs benefit ration landed me with  Honda 20 hp
25" shaft, of course the dealer was fantastic too so that helps.

A quick  note on electric  inboards. The cost of  the motor and  batteries would
have been 3  times the total of  the outboard solution. I didn't  even bother to
cost the installation  of it. It was  considered as a hypothetical  case, but it
was never really  an option. This of  course comes with the problem  of where to
store all those batteries. The same goes for electric POD motors.

Taking all of the  above and possibly a lot of things I  forgot about, it seemed
that the sensible choice would be to go for 20 hp. over 8 hp. for a 4 kg. weight
increase. The option to  go with a smaller engine is always  there too, not that
you gain much by going smaller, maybe if I  went for a 5 hp. motor it might have
made a noticeable difference in weight. Taleisin is 8 tons when empty, the 8 hp.
on the rubber  ducky does the job but  leaves a lot to be  desired and certainly
wont stop her in a  hurry if it's needed. I learnt that the  hard way when I got
defeated in the marina (see the post about it).
