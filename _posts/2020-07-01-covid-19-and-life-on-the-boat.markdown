We have just returned to Taleisin after a 3 week stint on land. Annie’s parents
are settling into their new house after they have been living overseas for many
years. We went down to help sort out furniture and belongings so that they can
downsize. Since we’ve done this ourselves, albeit far more extreme than they
would do, we thought that we might be able to offer some support in this area.
It’s tough to let go of things and it’s even tougher to decide what to keep. We
didn’t plan on spending that long away but it just turned out to be that long.
I did manage help Annie’s dad erect a fence.

I’ve had some fun and games with contractual work, as we’re in need to some
funds to keep us going. I thought our concerns would be behind us, but I had to
walk away from a contract due to a disagreement with the customer. While it was
a real nightmare it all worked out in the end as I’ve got a little bit of work
to generate some income again.

It’s been a while since I’ve published anything of substance. There’s multiple
reasons for this, but ultimately it was my own doing. Since I’ve added a patreon
account into the mix things have been on a steady decline. It’s not that I don’t
have anything say, on the contrary I have a lot to say. I’m of the old school
thinking that if you’re going to take money from people there should be a value
proposition. This lead me to write much longer pieces and that in turn lead to
decline in readers.

I didn’t want to be the writer who floods a blog with short entries and charging
patreons for the mess, it seems unethical to me so I thought I would deliver
more content so there’s a real value proposition. Unfortunately this lead to the
regular readers not reading the longer pieces as it consumes too much time.

So what happened to all my writings? Well there’s a manuscript. It covers the
last 5 years of our lives with Taleisin. Will it be published? Honestly I cannot
say at this point. I completed the rough draft in March. I’ve slowly been
editing away at it to turn it into something that might be worth the time to
read it. At present it’s around 100,000 words and it’s much too long. I find it
much harder to edit my work than I did to write it.

Life in the time of Covid-19

As most of you know we’re in New Zealand. This has been great as New Zealand
seems to be a bit more proactive about managing the spread of the virus. The
fact that it’s isolated might have something to do with it.

So what is it like living in a Covid-19 world aboard Taleisin? Honestly, it’s
not much different than life as usual. While we haven’t moved anchorage in
a while, we found life to be much the same during the lock down period. We had
a bubble with one other person and we spent our days hanging out and chipping
away at chores. It was a slow chip, we didn’t really make a dent in it.

It was rather amusing reading about people losing their minds. They have just
had our lifestyle thrust upon them. While it’s technically not identical,
there’s a lot of similarities. We understand that it’s one thing to voluntarily
do it, but quite another if it’s forced on you. The whole experience has made us
realise just how much we have changed and what we value today. Our only issue
was that we had a rough time provisioning, but we eventually managed to do it in
one giant swoop. Once the provisions was in place we returned to life as normal.

New Zealand is back to normal, or as close to normal as can be expected. The
rest of the world is still in pain and this is not lost on us. If you’re
suffering due to this I’ll leave you with this simple thought: “This too, shall
pass”.
