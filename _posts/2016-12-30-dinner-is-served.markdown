Annie prepared  this magnificent meal  on board  Taleisin tonight. It  tasted as
good as it looks.

After  a bit  of trial  and error  we figured  out how  to use  the oven  aboard
Taleisin. We did of  course have the benefit of being on a  mooring just a short
row from Lin's door step. Lin is  always very helpful and knows everything about
anything aboard Taleisin.

We've been  having a great time  in North Cove.  Lin invited us over  for dinner
along with the family on the French yacht next to us. Lin served what could only
be described as the best salmon I've  ever had. Everything is always lovely when
you're over  for dinner at  the Pardey's.  The company is  good and the  food is
always excellent!

We've had plenty of people come along  side Taleisin for a closer look. They are
always very friendly  and pleasant to have  a chat to. We've  been invited twice
already to  go visit some  friends along  one of the  beaches. We feel  a little
guilty as  we've been so lazy  that we haven't made  it there yet. To  be honest
we're probably just so exhausted from the rat race that we're in need of all the
sleep we've been catching up on.

Earlier today we decided to move to the correct mooring. Annie suggested that we
warp onto  the mooring as  it's close by  and it would  be easier to  put backup
plans in place, than to start up the  outboard. The added bonus is that it would
be quiet and, not disturb any of the boats around us.

Annie decided  that she would row  the warp out. We  attached a warp to  the old
mooring and to the stren, the warp Annie rowed out was attached to the bow. This
configuration allowed us to prevent Taleisin  from swinging into other boats, we
could control her speed by breaking with the  stern line on a winch, and most of
all we never  lost control of her.  We worked together to  keep Taleisin running
nicely along  the two  lines and  gently glided  her into  place on  the correct
mooring. It was fun and we've had lots  of practice at it already so we probably
didn't look too  terrible doing it. We've  even had some kind  comments about it
from the other sailors.

Among the  other small jobs I've  been doing on  Taleisin I replaced the  last 2
halyards, she's  looking quite fresh  with the  majority of the  lines replaced.
Doing one or two a day really adds up quickly. Replacing the lifelines will take
quite a bit of effort as it involves the jib net and sewing leather anti-chafing
onto the lines where they go through the stanchions.

All in  good time, it doesn't  feel like work as  it's quite enjoyable to  do. I
think the key is  to slowly chip away at these jobs  and everything just becomes
manageable. Maintenance  is a  lot less of  a chore when  you're already  on the
boat, it  seems to just  happen as  a matter of  course. When you  see something
small that needs doing, you just do it.

So far cruising  seems to be great!  We're loving it and  most importantly we're
still talking to each other!
