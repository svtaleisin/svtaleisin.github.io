A simple question, often asked. The answer is not quite as simple.

Buying a boat like Taleisin seems like a rather strange thing to do. If you read
the forums on the internet you'll see  that people said she's an old wooden boat
with no engine, no market for something like that. So why did we buy her?

Good question!

To answer this we need to go back in time a little. When I was younger I used to
always  look  at  motor  yachts,  they  look sleek  and  they  are  loaded  with
technology. I'm  a computer programmer/hacker  so naturally it makes  sense that
I'm attracted to  technology. Sailing is archaic  and for old guys  with lots of
time, not to mention  that it takes forever to get anywhere. I  got caught up in
the rat race, worked some horrible jobs over the years got taken advantage of by
a few companies and eventually started consulting. This is when I really started
to burn the  candle at both ends.  When you're working for  yourself you usually
have the worst boss  in the world. How ever during the early  years working as a
consultant we took a vacation in Fiji, the resort had a couple of Hobi Cat boats
that we could sail.  I absolutely loved it! I couldn't get enough  of it. But we
returned to the real world and that experience faded into a distant memory.

After  a few  more years  I was  "successful" we  had the  huge house,  the huge
mortgage, and it was  filled with a huge pile of stuff. At  this point I started
setting my  sighs on  a yacht. I  was browsing the  internet and  stared lusting
after 57 foot production boats. Bigger is always better...

So the researching started.  I was fairly committed to a  large yacht. I started
consuming information  on the  internet. I'm a  compulsive researcher,  some say
it's a blessing, others say it's a  curse. I spent hours looking into what makes
a good  yacht. I  started looking at  building boats, it  doesn't seem  all that
complicated and it  would certainly be a  fun project. Annie put a  halt to that
pretty quickly when I  started measuring the garage to see if I  could fit it in
there and get it out. I looked at small dinghy plans and at something larger, it
would be nice to  spend a weekend on it. If your mind  works like mine, it won't
be long before you're  at the extreme end of the scale. If  at this point you're
thinking, "This guy is all over the place", you're right! My mind will make huge
leaps  and race  off into  all sorts  of different  directions, most  people get
exhausted  when they  have a  conversation with  me (I'm  working on  being less
intense). If you've done  any research on boats and boats  that can cross oceans
(I was surprised at  how small blue water boats can be), it  won't take you long
before you come across Lin and Larry Pardey.

It wasn't long  before I was reading the Pardey  books. Something changed inside
me when I saw the simplicity and  what's achievable on a small budget. I started
to have new found  existential questions. Why am I on  this treadmill? It wasn't
long before I realised that bigger is not better. Doing more research on yachts,
now of the  Pardey variety. It wasn't  long before I realised  that Taleisin was
for sale.  I couldn't believe it.  The next question  on my mind was,  "Where is
she?" Kawau Island, New Zealand! Checking google maps, it's close, very close. I
fired off an email  to the broker stating that I'm interested  and would like to
have a  look, I have a  million questions, but  without looking at her  we won't
know if she's right for us.

I knew that Lin and Larry wouldn't just  sell her to anybody, so I approached it
very open  and honest. We  have hardly any  sailing experience, would  they sell
their baby to  a couple of green  horns? The broker responded with  a reply from
Lin, in the  email was a phone number  and email on which I could  reach Lin. Me
being a little more old fashioned grabbed the phone and gave Lin a call. I can't
recall the  exact conversation, but  Lin said something  along the lines  of "So
you're thinking  about becoming a  sailor?", we talked for  a while and  she was
just fantastic.  She gave me a  lot of good  advice, I stated open  and honestly
that we don't know  if Taleisin is right for us, but we  sure would love to come
and see her to figure out if she just might be the boat for us.

Lin invited us to  Kawau Island for lunch and a tour of  the lovely Taleisin. We
arranged a  date that was  well in advance. To  put thing into  perspective I've
managed to  get Annie  to agree to  go to the  on water  boat show a  few months
earlier, when  I did  this I  was only  wanting to  have a  look. I  wasn't very
serious but  knew I wanted to  get more serious  about buying a yacht.  The boat
show was the weekend before we were supposed to go and see Lin and Larry.

At the boat  show I dragged poor  Annie through all the yachts,  she wasn't very
happy as she's  not very comfortable around water. She  was apprehensive getting
on the boats  and wouldn't even go up  on the foredeck as it was  too narrow for
her liking. After the  show we talked about the various boats  we'd been on, she
honestly  couldn't tell  them apart.  Annie's comment  was, "they  were all  the
same". She  didn't like them very  much, I'm talking about  production Jeanneau,
Beneteau, Bavaria, and Hanse boats to name a few. We looked at boats starting at
37 foot and  moving up to 57  foot. I learnt just  how large a 57  foot yacht is
(trust me it's WAY  too big for 2 people). The one thing  all these boats had in
common was their stability. They were bouncing a lot just in the marina.

I patiently waited till we managed to make  our way to Kawau, on the way there I
said to Annie, "now  remember, this is an older boat and  nothing like the boats
we've been looking at". I later found  out that Annie was secretly thinking that
we're about to look at a rotting old boat needing a lot of work.

If you're familiar with our relationship  dynamics you'll know that Annie leaves
me to do all the homework but retains  veto power. This allows me to research to
my hearts  content, get the  decision 99%  of the way  there and then  let Annie
decide if it's is right (I get vetoed  a lot). This is very important because if
she lets me, I'll make a lot of snap decisions that would probably all be wrong.
It's great to be able to make a decision and then have it verified, it's sort of
a safety net. In many ways Annie is  my sanity check, with a mind like mine it's
easy to go down rabbit holes and forget that there's a top side.

Coming into the cove going past Taleisin  I pointed her out to Annie, she smiled
and said, "now that's a NICE boat". I knew I had a fighting chance here! Getting
off the ferry we made our way up  to what can only be described as a magnificent
little house  with magical surroundings. We  met Lin and Larry,  they were super
friendly. Then Lin said, "right lets go play boat".

Off to Taleisin we went! I was quite excited as I had looked at all the photos I
could find  online. I had  even purchased  the 5 DVD's  that Lin and  Larry made
(well the  digital versions  anyway). I had  of course not  told Annie  how much
research I  had put into this.  In fact I had  watched the videos twice  by then
already. So getting on board this little ship was a very exciting prospect, even
though I had already spent a lot of time "aboard".

The first thing I  noticed was how comfortable Annie was, as soon  as she got on
deck. She  was wondering around very  naturally. I quietly mentioned  to Lin how
this is a first, Annie is NOT  comfortable on boats. I was probably grinning ear
to ear. Lin took us down below.

My first thoughts were  "holy crap she's small"! Then we sat  down in the saloon
and Lin started telling us more about  her and showing us all the awesome little
details they had put into her. The more  I looked the more I saw. It didn't take
me long to fall in love with her. I think it went something like this "holy crap
she's small! Look  at the detail, she's  awesome. I LOVE this boat,  I MUST have
her"! It was seconds  or less for me to fall in love  with Taleisin, this is not
the way  to buy a  boat! I had  been warned, Lin even  writes about this  in her
books. My  fate was sealed how  ever. Lin showed  us many things, many  things I
already  knew  from doing  my  homework.  I asked  what  I  hope was  many  good
questions. Lin  was quite happy  to answer all my  questions and I'm  sure there
were coming out rapidly.  I don't doubt that I asked  follow up questions before
Lin could even finish answering the first question (remember I'm very exhausting
to be around at times - I'm working on this).

After I exhausted Lin we went back to land for lunch and Lin asked us more about
ourselves. I explained our current situation and how we're wanting to change it.
Life is  over complicated,  we want  to simplify. Taleisin  is awesome,  she can
teach us about cruising  and simplicity. I was again very  open and honest about
everything. Lin  then asked Annie how  she felt about  it, Annie is quite  a bit
more reserved  about things  than I am.  Lin could tell  that Annie  was mulling
things over and not as  quick to fire as I am. At this  point Lin said she would
take us out for a sail on Taleisin, but we would have to go and learn the basics
first.

We bid Lin and Larry farewell and got on the ferry to go home. I think we talked
it all over on the  way home or even that night. I said  to Annie, I really love
that boat,  I don't know  how you  feel about her.  Annie told me  that Taleisin
certainly stood out from the crowd, she had character and was something special.
Annie could actually remember  details from Taleisin but had no  clue as to what
the production boats looked like. After some too and fro Annie said, well if you
love the boat so much, why don't you buy her?

I arranged for sailing lessons as soon as  we could fit them in. Annie is a high
school teacher and  her schedule is very  hectic. While all of this  is going on
Annie had managed to  arrange for me to go on a day  sail on Steinlarger 2,an 83
foot off shore  racing ketch, as part  of a group of  teachers. The arrangements
was made  long before  we even  knew we were  going to  buy Taleisin.  While out
sailing on Steinlarger 2 I remember thinking how  glad I am that we didn't buy a
bigger boat!

So I started down  the path of putting an offer in. I  knew the normal procedure
for doing  this as I'd been  reading a lot  of information on the  internet. How
ever, this  was not a  normal situation (things hardly  ever seems to  be normal
when I'm involved). I  called Lin up and said "I'd like to  buy Taleisin, but we
have a few complications we need to sort  out first..." I did what could only be
described as the worlds worst job at negotiating a price, I asked Lin what she'd
be willing to accept and that was my offer! To many people thing might seem like
a silly strategy, but in my view,  buying a boat like Taleisin is something very
special, I knew that I wanted to have a good relationship with Lin and Larry and
I certainly  did not want them  to feel like I  had driven a hard  bargain. This
process took place  over a few weeks, I  had to get some finances  sorted and we
decided to  put our house on  the market so  we could pay for  Taleisin. Selling
your house  to buy a  boat might seem  like a strange thing  to do. But  it felt
right, this was a once in a lifetime opportunity that we could not allow to slip
away. We had discussed this at length (even though I had already made my mind up
within seconds  of boarding Taleisin).  After explaining the challenge  ahead of
myself  to Lin  (again probably  not  a very  good  strategy, but  I believe  in
transparency and honesty), We came to an arrangement of a long settlement.

So after agreeing the whole deal with Lin,  I put in an offer through the broker
(remember how I said  nothing is normal when I get  involved). The whole process
was rather straight forward since we'd already  agreed on the terms. It was also
very pleasant!  The next  step was to  arrange the survey.  I called  around and
asked many people who  would be a good surveyor. Eventually  someone told me Ray
Beale is the best  there is for this kind of boat. I  called Ray up and arranged
for him to come and survey Taleisin. I  went out to Kawau to witness the survey.
I arrived early so I could help Lin  put Taleisin on the tidal grid (we had many
phone conversations leading up to this).

After we put Taleisin on the tidal grid I had to wait for Ray to arrive. Lin was
kind enough to  leave me to my own  devices (maybe she was smart  enough to know
that I'll be  firing a million questions  her way if she was  within earshot). I
was in  and out of  Taleisin, inspecting and investigating  as much as  I could.
There's a LOT to investigate on Taleisin  (I'm still learning about new things I
didn't know about almost 18 months after I  first set foot on her). From time to
time Lin would come and check on me  and I'd fire off a few questions, listening
carefully to the answers so I can remember them.

I was super excited and it took the entire day. I was asking a million questions
listening to  everything Ray had to  say. Taking on board  as much as I  can and
trying to short circuit the learning  process by taking advantage of the decades
of experience I  was surrounded with. I'm very fortunate  that my most important
asset is  my natural ability to  learn, learn quickly  and on the fly  (it helps
tremendously with the day job), I'm usually pretty good at applying things after
that too. I  talked to Ray after  it was all done  and we were back  on the main
land. The comment he  made was something along the lines  of, "you couldn't have
picked a better boat of that construction if you tried".

So pretty much knowing  the survey would come back good I  was getting ready for
the next  step, the sea trial.  I can't recall  exactly when we had  our sailing
lessons,  as with  anything I'm  learning I  had already  studied so  much about
sailing online and in books that by the  time we had lessons I was well ahead of
the class. I  had a blast, the  boat we learnt on  was a 47 foot  sloop, again I
recall thinking I'm glad we bought a smaller boat.

Eventually we went out for the sea trial. It was awesome. Everything on Taleisin
is people sized. Everything is simple and easy to handle. It took a while for us
to get all our ducks in a row, but we were not backing out of the deal, Taleisin
was ours  we just had to  get all the pieces  in the right place.  I was reading
internet forums well  before I even saw  Taleisin, I read all  the things people
posted on the  forums but decided to make  up my own mind. I have  no doubt that
there'a a  lot of people  out there thinking  that we paid  too much for  an old
wooden boat with no engine, and those people  are right - to them she is just an
old wooden boat  with no engine. To us,  even though we were not  sailors at the
time, she was a magnificent creation.  Built like nothing else, safe, simple and
pure joy  to be aboard.  Making things simple is  not easy, Taleisin  is simple,
this is very valuable.

Lin invited us to stay aboard Taleisin to see what it would be like to spend the
night on her. I  can't recall the exact order of events, but  I do know we spent
quite a bit of time staying on Taleisin on the mooring. It just felt right!

Taleisin  contains 40+  years of  real hardcore  cruising experience,  these are
things we  don't have to  figure out  for ourselves. Being  able to pick  up the
phone and call Lin  with questions is also very valuable. The  price we paid for
Taleisin was not just for an old wooden  boat, we gained so much more out of the
deal. In  all honesty  Taleisin is  worth a  lot more  than we  paid for  her in
materials alone, the labour to build her is not even factored in.

There's a lot  more space in Taleisin than  I realised at first. This  is a very
big little boat. The photos and the  videos of Taleisin does not do her justice.
She's so much more in the flesh.  Something else that's very nice about Taleisin
is that  she's alive.  She has character.  Her planks are  infused with  Lin and
Larry's soul, when I look around her and  touch her you can see and feel Lin and
Larry everywhere.  There's so much history,  so many adventures. Being  on board
Taleisin is  magical, I  know it's still  early days  but I hope  we can  do her
justice and  add to her  legacy. Taleisin will no  doubt outlive both  Annie and
myself (she's that  well constructed), all we  have to do is look  after her. We
don't do  anything lightly,  we know the  world has  eyes on us.  We want  to do
what's right for Taleisin, the thought of  making holes in her pains both of us.
We have not made any alterations to her.  When we had her on the hard there were
many tense moments (more  about that in a future post). I know  that Lin told me
that she's  our boat  and we  can do  as we please  with her,  but when  you own
something that's got a soul it's difficult to do something that goes against her
very  being. We  enjoy looking  after her,  being forced  to think  about things
before we do them is a good thing.

Taleisin might not be perfect, but she's perfect for us!
