Two posts in rapid succession... Something must be interesting...

As you can tell from the title, this is bound to be good!

Today I was busy refining some wood work I've been doing on Taleisin's rub rail.
Annie was  about to go talk  to Lin about  planting some flowers for  her (Annie
loves gardening, Lin's got  a garden that needs tending so  it's a great match).
Annie asked  me while  I was  working to  check on  the cake  she's baking  in 5
minutes and put the timer on the deck  next to where I was working. I warned her
that asking me  to do something while  I'm working on something  else is fraught
with risk. None the less, Annie insisted that the task is simple!

My instructions  were to take  the cake out  of the oven  in 5 minutes,  stick a
knife in it  to see if it's  ready and if it's not  to put it back  in the oven.
Seems simple right?

Well let me tell you something about my  focus, when I'm focussed on the task at
hand, nothing can distract me and nothing else gets absorbed...

The timer went off, I put my chisel  down and went below deck. I pulled the cake
out of the oven, as instructed. I stabbed  it with a knife (no, this is not what
caused it to look like it does in  the picture), it was cooked. It seemed like a
good idea at the time  to be helpful and take the cake out of  the tin (we use a
bread tin as it seems to produce a better  cake on the boat), I tipped it out on
the cooling rack. Disaster struck!

How was  I supposed to  know that I  had to let  it sit for  a while? How  was I
supposed to  know that I had  to loosen the sides  first? How was I  supposed to
know that you  place the rack on top of  the tin **before** you tip the  cake out? I
was left unsupervised attempting to do something I had no business doing....

Needless to  say my  first reaction  was oh ^%$#,  she's going  to murder  me! I
quickly put it back  in the tin, then I thought the only  smart move to be would
be to make a run  for it! I high tailed it up the dock and  as Annie passed me I
said I'll just save her the hassle and go set up camp for the night!

Annie gave me a look and said: "What have you done?" 

I kept walking....

Twenty seconds later Annie yelled at me from the boat: "WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO MY
CAKE!!! GET BACK  HERE AND EXPLAIN YOURSELF.  You were only supposed  to take it
out of the oven, NOTHING ELSE!"

Naturally I was reluctant as a 5 year  old knowing they are being called over to
receive a hiding  for the mischief they  have just committed. I  skulked back to
the boat and started apologising profusely.

Now if you're  a guy, and you've been  in a situation like this  before you know
what's going through my mind at this moment...

I think it'll suffice to say that Annie was less than impressed with me! I tried
to explain that  it still tastes good and  we're going to make it  look worse by
way of actually eating it.

Luckily I escaped this time with only stern words, next time I might be sleeping
on deck or worse in the dinghy!

I feel  terrible about messing  up the cake,  I didn't do  it on purpose.  I was
looking forward to it as much as Annie. I guess I'll have to wait a bit before I
suggest eating  it regardless!  It does  taste good in  spite of  the way  it looks
though! I wasn't  going to miss an opportunity  to taste one of the  many bits I
broke it into...

On the bright side, we'll save time not having to cut it before we serve it!
