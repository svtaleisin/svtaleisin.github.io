This might be  the post most of  the people following this little  blog has been
waiting for. Well maybe, we're not heading  off shore, but we have cast the dock
lines off  for the  time being.  We've got  the boat  provisioned and  we're out
playing!

This will be a little longer than  the previous weekend cruise we did (I haven't
written about it yet, but it was  great). We're currently sitting at anchor in a
small bay called Okoromai (Shakespeare) Bay.  We're the only boat anchored here,
and there might be a reason for that we're not sure yet.

Our  plan  was to  sail  to  Kawau  Island today,  but  there  was no  wind,  so
unfortunately we had to use the noisy  outboard motor to get away from the dock.
The bottom line is that we're out, away from the dock and we're sailing! Well we
will be! We've decided to hang out in this little bay until the wind picks up so
we can continue our little journey to Kawau Island.

There's not much to  say about the adventure today as  it was rather uneventful.
We managed  to leave the marina  just fine, which of  course is a huge  bonus as
we've not had the best of luck with marina adventures to date! We managed to get
a  bit of  sailing done  in  the harbour  but  then the  winds died  completely.
Motoring is not fun  and we didn't really care for it. It  was really a means to
an end,  now that we've left  the doc we don't  feel the pressure of  needing to
leave. That part is done!

Given that we've been  so busy with the run up to Christmas  we're both tired so
now  it's time  to rest  and recover  from all  the stress  we've placed  on our
bodies.

Below are  some pictures  of the  little anchorage we're  in. We're  anchored in
about 4.5 meters of water and so far it would seem like a calm quite anchorage!
