This might seem like a strange post. In fact it is. I was contacted by John, who
needed to  know the dimensions  of a  particular spring in  Taleisin's Windlass.
He's got the same Windlass and the spring  is in pieces. I figured that I'd post
this as it just might come in handy for someone else in the future.

First up, here's the plastic pieces.

From what I've read the strength of a spring is determined by:<br />
1. Wire diameter<br />
2. Outer diameter<br />
3. Free Length (length of spring)<br />  
4. Number of total coils<br />

Wire diameter: 0.7 mm

Outer diameter: 5mm

Free length: 39.9mm

I counted 57 coils, also 39.9 / 0.7 = 57

I also measured the ends: 26.4mm (but this might be a little bit off as I didn't
remove the screw).

Here's a calculator that might be of use: [Calculator - external link](http://www.acxesspring.com/extension-spring-calculator-instructions.html)

Estimate of length inside "hooks" 92.360 mm.

If you need more accuracy, let me know,  and I'll take screws out and measure it
correctly.
