We have been very fortunate over the  last few years with the opportunities that
have crossed  our path. Lin  has introduced us to  wonderful new friends  and we
have been  invited to  go along on  many wonderful adventures  (I still  have to
write about  many of  them). While  travelling in  the USA  we came  across many
people and we invited many  people to look us up if they were  to make it to New
Zealand. I recall saying to Annie that if  anybody does take us up on the offer,
and I doubt many will, I will make good on my promise to take them sailing.

When we were about  to leave Port Townsend for the  second time (there's another
story here),  we were  buying some  supplies from Admiral  Ships Supply  in Port
Townsend and talking to a few locals. They enquired as to where we were from, we
replied:  New Zealand!  Another  customer  suddenly said,  we're  coming to  New
Zealand later  this year.  We got  talking and  discovered that  Brad is  a boat
builder and he was aware of Taleisin. He told  us his wife was a huge fan of the
Pardeys and has followed Taleisin for a  long time. Since Brad was coming to New
Zealand with his family we exchanged details. We told Brad that they should look
us up when they are in New Zealand and we'd be happy to show them Taleisin.

A lot  of time  passed and  we'd not  heard a word  from anybody  we met  on our
adventures in the USA. We were starting to think that nobody was going to accept
our invitation and carried  on with life as usual. A few days  ago while we were
busy  pulling out  Sikaflex from  some deck  seams to  replace it  I got  a text
message on my phone. It read:

---

Hey Eben and Annie, it's Brad from Port Townsend... my family and I are going to
be in Auckland  tomorrow and I was  wondering if you happen to  be around. Sorry
for the late notice... New Zealand has  been an amazing country and sadly we are
leaving very late tomorrow night...

---

I told  Annie that Brad just  got in touch with  us but he's about  to leave New
Zealand. We quickly decided to call him and  see where they were at the time and
if they would be  able to come to Kawau Island for the  day. Brad said he'd have
to check with his wife first to make sure it was OK to make plans for their last
day. After a bit of back and forth Brad said that they were good to go and would
see us the next  morning. I sent them the relevant information on  how to get to
us and how  to make travel arrangements.  When Brad came back and  asked if they
should only stay  for an hour or a  bit longer, I said well that  depends if you
want to go for a sail or not.

This last  statement caused a bit  of a stir in  the family unit. Coming  to see
Taleisin is  one thing, but sailing  on her is  another thing. I could  hear the
tone changing in the conversation instantly,  this was a whole new adventure that
they weren't  planning on. The  excitement was  certainly building on  the other
side of the phone.

Of course we still had a lot of work  to do on Taleisin, we pulled out four deck
seams and we were still working on re-caulking them. It was a very hot day so we
started early in the morning but were  unable to do anything until it started to
cool down. These  seams are some of the  longest on the boat and  we were losing
day light. Both  of us were tired  but we had to  press on, if we  didn't make a
commitment to go sailing we would have left it till the next day.

We pushed on and finished just as the sun set. It wasn't part of the plan but we
were happy when we  were done. There were still a few things  that we could only
do the next morning, but we felt good about it and knew it was not going to be a
huge rush to get things done. Given the excitement I heard in Brad's voice about
the prospect of sailing on Taleisin, I was glad that we wouldn't be letting them
down.

The  next morning  when we  woke up,  I removed  the tape  around the  seams and
knocked the top  off the Sikaflex with  a chisel, which also  removes the ridges
around the  seam from  wear. The  end result is  a nice  smooth finish  and deck
that  is much  easier  on your  body.  I  had to  replace  the stays'l  fairlead
(un-affectionately known  as the damned toe  stubber), which had a  seam running
right underneath it. I bedded it and fixed it back in place.

While I  was taking care  of the deck Annie  prepared Taleisin for  sailing down
below. Not wanting our guests to sit around waiting for us to get Taleisin ready
to sail we got  everything as ready as possible up on deck.  The only thing left
to do was  get the 2 kids in  life jackets, row the family over  to Taleisin and
drop the mooring so we could leave.

We had earlier  managed to find a  place to borrow child sized  life jackets and
went  to retrieve  those so  that we're  ready as  soon as  Brad and  his family
arrived.

We didn't have to wait long for our  guests to arrive, I met them on Lin's jetty
and explained that  in New Zealand it's  the law for kids to  wear life jackets.
Adults is  at the skippers  discretion. Given that all  the adults could  swim I
didn't force them to wear life jackets since the water was calm.

We rowed  over to  Taleisin and Brad  and Kirsten were  very excited.  They kept
thanking us  for going out of  our way and saying  what a big deal  this was for
them. We just smiled and said we were glad they could make it, but really should
have contacted us earlier as there  were missed opportunities. Kirsten gave Brad
the look, if you're a guy you're familiar with the look.

Brad and  Kirsten were  bursting at the  seams and asked  to see  Taleisin below
deck. We all went down below and they were smiling from ear to ear. Kirsten kept
repeating, is this  real, is this really happening? While  Brad and Kirsten were
busy trying to take  in all the details on Taleisin and telling  us how lucky we
are to own her,  their youngest, Angus, popped his head  into the companion way.
He looked me straight in  the eye and said: Are you going to  take me for a boat
ride or what?

Mum and dad were  quick to tell him that he's not in  charge, but it was awesome
to see  his enthusiasm to get  out on the water!  We informed him that  we'll be
going out soon  and that he's just got  to be patient a little  longer. I'm sure
that the time  we spent down below was  far too short for Brad  and Kirsten, but
none the less I said that we should get  ready to cast off if they wanted to get
out on the water.

Everybody was  very excited  all of  a sudden.  We started  the outboard  up and
dropped the mooring line. We were soon on our way out of North Cove. Since there
wasn't  much wind  we  opted to  motor  as we  could have  taken  up the  entire
afternoon just trying to get out of the Cove.

As soon  as we got out  of North Cove  we got the  sails up. I offered  Brad the
helm, which  he eagerly  accepted and  we were  off on  a sailing  adventure. We
taught them how to  manage the lines on Taleisin and we sat  back and relaxed.
I could actually stroll  around the deck and  trim the sails to my  liking. It
was really nice to have crew while I messed around with the details.

Unfortunately it wasn't long before young Angus  felt a little green, we put him
down below  on a pilot  berth and mum  went to keep  him company. While  mum and
Angus  were down  below, Luella  was  finding her  groove on  deck. She  quickly
discovered that if she sat on the companionway hatch that she was out of the way
of everybody, the motion was pretty good too, since she was closer to the centre
of the boat. She  lay herself across the hatch and had the  biggest smile on her
face.

It was around  the half way mark of  our sail that Luella said "Dad,  can we buy
this boat"? Having  people offer to buy Taleisin  is nothing new to us,  but a 9
year old girl offering  to buy her is quite new to us.  She clearly fell in love
with Taleisin and commented on the fact that this boat is for adventures! I just
smiled and  thought to myself,  Taleisin is an  adventure machine, even  a young
child can see that.

Brad  got Luella  to take  the helm  under close  supervision and  it was  quite
surprising to  see that  even a  small child  could steer  the boat.  Granted we
weren't doing  7 knots+ which  makes it quite  a bit harder  to steer, but  at 5
knots she was doing just fine.

Brad offered Kirsten the helm and soon the  whole family was up on deck again. I
could tell this was a dream come true for Kirsten, she loved every moment of it.
We sailed  around a  bit longer  before we  decided that  it's probably  time to
return to the mooring and ensure that the family is ready for the ferry.

When we retuned to  the mooring Annie and I worked swiftly  to put Taleisin back
in order so  we could get the  boom tent up and  our guests out of  the hot sun.
While we  were kicking back in  the cockpit Lin stopped  by on her way  out to a
meeting. Lin recognised Kirsten and they had a bit of a chat. Lin suggested that
we give the family the tour of her property.

When we  were about to  say out good  byes Kirsten said"  "we don't know  how we
could possibly repay  you for this". Both  Annie and I smiled and  said that the
way to repay us  would be to pay it forward. If it  wasn't for others showing us
amazing things and enabling  us to have adventures we would  not have had nearly
as many  adventures as  we've had.  We explained that  we're doing  this because
others have done it for  us, and this is the kind of world  we'd like to live in
so we'll keep doing it.

We feel very fortunate that we've come across many individuals who have gone out
of their way to ensure we have a  good time. It's impossible for us to pay those
people back  even if  we tried. The  only way we  can pay  them back is  to keep
paying it  forward. We saw  our new  friends off with  a warm feeling  and loved
every minute of their pleasure. The whole family clearly had a fantastic day and
a wonderful  send off from New  Zealand. It made both  of us very happy  that we
could put  the final touch  on what  was already a  fantastic 9 week  holiday in
lovely New Zealand.  We also feel good  that we could pay it  forward to someone
from Port Townsend. We owe this little town so much, the people we have met over
there are wonderful. If we couldn't live on  our boat or live in New Zealand, we
would like to live in Port Townsend!
