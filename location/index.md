We're experimenting with new technology aboard Taleisin. After a passage we
won't forget anytime soon, we decided to get some technology to allow us to get
weather forecasts while out at sea. As a bonus we get this nifty tracking
feature.

While we hope this will be a fun addition we have to stress that technology is
far from perfect. As we have already experienced, it's possible to damage our
solar panels out there and be unable to charge our technology. This does not
mean that we cannot keep sailing and navigate safely. So in the event that the
tracker stops working, the simplest answer is generally the correct answer:
We're not able to charge it for some or other reason. In the event that
something does go horribly wrong we have at least 5 different ways of calling
for rescue aboard and we'll active one or more beacons at that time if required.
The absolute last thing we want this page to do is cause people to worry about
us (it wouldn't do us or you any good regardless). So please enjoy this at face
value and remember that technology can and will fail, it doesn't mean the boat
has sunk!

If power consumption becomes an issue for us we'll scale back our tracking
frequency to only update when we get a new weather update. This could be one or
more days apart depending on what we're dealing with out there.
