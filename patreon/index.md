We thought we'd explain our reasons for adding Patreon.

Firstly, lets be clear, this is not about asking our readers for money. We do
not want another job, we can always go back to work if we wanted that.

This is about motivating us to write more consistently and publish regularly. If
you're happy  with the way  we're creating posts, we're  quite happy for  you to
ignore Patreon. If how  ever, you'd like to motivate us  to write more regularly
and publish on a  regular basis... You can use this mechanism  to motivate us to
do so.

While we do enjoy  the process of writing, it seems to  get neglected when we're
too busy having fun or dealing with  life. We don't anticipate people wanting to
put huge  amounts of money in  our motivation jar. If  you feel the need  to add
some spare change to the jar, we thank you for the consideration. All funds will
go towards  hosting this blog, once  that's covered we'll put  all funds towards
maintaining Taleisin.  Since we  do all  the work ourselves  it will  go towards
buying varnish,  paint and sandpaper. We  doubt that we'll have  more money left
over after that,  but if that was  to happen we'll come up  with some worthwhile
cause to contribute it towards.

Thanks for looking further into this. 

The  way Patreon  operates is  that every  time  we write  a blog  post that  we
consider is worthy of  the motivation jar we can post it  on Patreon and Patrons
will get charged accordingly. This means  if we write silly little updates there
will be no charge, only posts that takes  effort to write will be worthy of this
treatment. You can also set a budget  so that you'll never get charged more than
you're willing to contribute in a  month. This mechanism safe guards you against
us doing silly things like writing 200 posts in a month.

Currently we've chosen to accept payments per  post as it serves as a motivating
factor. We think this will work the  best otherwise the motivation wont be there
with a monthly contribution...

If you're interested in  adding some spare change click on  the orange button to
become a  patron. You can  chose to stop  when ever you  want, we won't  take it
personally. If  you chose not  to become a patron,  we won't take  that personal
either. Thanks for reading!
